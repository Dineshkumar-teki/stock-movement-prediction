      "Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.\n",

      "Post #5: Do you guys believe we are in the beginning of “the great melt up” or that a recession is coming in the somewhat near future ? While there are some signs pointing to a recession in the not so distant future such as the inversion and now re steepening of the yield curve and the sahm rule triggering as well as P/E ratios which are incredibly high. There is also the argument that the government cannot afford a recession at the moment and will not allow one to occur, we are in too much debt and cannot afford these high interest payments meaning that the government will chat interest rates again and spend as much as it needs to to avoid a recession causing hyperinflation and a “great melt up” in all assets, instead of an everything bubble it will be come an everything mega bubble which will last until the end of the decade. I see arguments for both sides and think they both make sense. On one hand government spending is so high and they will keep it that way to avoid a recession, on the other hand this isn’t the first time we’ve had very elevated levels of government spending and they have not been able to prevent a recession in the past and that the indicators I listed earlier have a pretty high accuracy rate. What do you guys think? \n"
