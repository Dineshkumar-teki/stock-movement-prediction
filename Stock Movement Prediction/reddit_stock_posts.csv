Meta Announces $10 Billion Data Center in Louisiana,"[https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a](https://www.barrons.com/articles/meta-data-center-louisiana-location-2828b80a)

META, the parent company of Facebook, is spending $10 billion to build its largest data center ever in Louisiana, the company confirmed on Wednesday.

The data center will take up 4 million square feet of an industrial site in the northern half of the state that once held a headlight factory.

The center will be powered by three new natural gas plants with 2.2 gigawatts of combined capacity, according to Entergy, the utility working with the tech giant. That is enough to power more than one million homes. Neal Kirby, an Entergy spokesman, said the plants will also provide power to the surrounding community.

“Entergy raised its earnings growth outlook substantially (solely because of this 1 new customer) and the stock rose 15% on that day,” wrote Rodney Rebello, an analyst covering power stocks at Reaves Asset Management, in an email to *Barron’s*. “It’s a monumental deal for the sector.”

Meta spokeswoman Stacey Yip told *Barron’s* the Louisiana data center “will be significantly larger than our other data center campuses.”

The company didn’t say how many GPUs the new facility will be able to support. Yip said estimating the future number of GPUs is becoming complex as GPU technology becomes more efficient.

Yip also said Meta will invest in 1.5 gigawatts worth of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, to reduce its carbon footprint. All told, Meta will help finance “enough clean and renewable energy to the grid to match the total electricity use of this data center,” she wrote in an email.

But it isn’t clear when those renewable projects will start. Entergy has filed for permission with the state utilities commission to build the natural gas plants, but not the renewable ones yet, Kirby said.

Meta also said on Tuesday that it is exploring using nuclear energy to power data centers, and asked companies in that field to submit proposals for nuclear reactors. Any reactors wouldn’t be available until well into the 2030s, however.

Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence and has been expanding the number of data centers it uses to process its AI applications. But even as the AI race accelerates, this Louisiana data center doesn’t look like it will be completed soon. The company said construction will “continue through 2030 with site work beginning in December.”

Do you guys believe we are in the beginning of “the great melt up” or that a recession is coming in the somewhat near future ?,"While there are some signs pointing to a recession in the not so distant future such as the inversion and now re steepening of the yield curve and the sahm rule triggering as well as P/E ratios which are incredibly high. There is also the argument that the government cannot afford a recession at the moment and will not allow one to occur, we are in too much debt and cannot afford these high interest payments meaning that the government will chat interest rates again and spend as much as it needs to to avoid a recession causing hyperinflation and a “great melt up” in all assets, instead of an everything bubble it will be come an everything mega bubble which will last until the end of the decade. I see arguments for both sides and think they both make sense. On one hand government spending is so high and they will keep it that way to avoid a recession, on the other hand this isn’t the first time we’ve had very elevated levels of government spending and they have not been able to prevent a recession in the past and that the indicators I listed earlier have a pretty high accuracy rate.

"Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk","Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever.

Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself.

Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses.

But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds.

“They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.”

In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder.

The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world.

Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems.

Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal.

Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger.

“Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell.

“Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.”

Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department

Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money.

But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult.

“I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?”

If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses.

“You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.”

While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips.

“I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. ""There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.”

Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO.

Amazon sued by DC attorney general for allegedly excluding neighborhoods from Prime delivery,"Washington, D.C.’s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation’s capital from access to Prime’s high-speed delivery.

The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has “secretly excluded” two “historically underserved” D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon’s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.

“Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,” Schwalb said in a statement. “While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.”

In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.

The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience “significantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,” the lawsuit says.

Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.

Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company said it would expand access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after a Bloomberg investigation found Black residents were “about half as likely” to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.

The ZIP codes in Schwalb’s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.

The Federal Trade Commission also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and “sabotaging” their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was “false on the facts and the law.” The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.

According to Scwalb’s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.

The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district’s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to “put an end to Amazon’s deceptive conduct,” as well as for damages and penalties.

To get packages to customers’ doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.

Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company said it recorded its “fastest Prime delivery speeds ever” in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.

In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.

In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences “violence, intimidation or harassment.” The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.

Bolivia Signs Major Lithium Deal – Not Great News for Lithium Players,"

Bad news—Bolivia has just signed a $1 billion deal with China’s CBC Investments to build two lithium carbonate plants at the Salar de Uyuni. These plants will produce a combined 35,000 metric tons of lithium per year!

Bolivia is home to over 21 million metric tons of lithium, mostly found beneath the vast Salar de Uyuni salt flats..It’s actually one of the largest lithium reserves in the world! 

While this is a big step for Bolivia in becoming a key player in the lithium market, it might not be good news for other lithium players.  More output, driving down lithium price.

realty income REIT hypotetical,"i think 10%ish of their properties have failing business like dollar general and walgreens.

for purposes of this hypothetical, assume these companies will continue to shrink, so also assume this part of their portfolio is freed up.

it seems that no similar business would rent there anymore.

it seems different types of businesses wouldnt want to rent there bc those buildings and locations seem specifically tailored and niche to the previous renters business model.

what does O do? sell them? hold them and hope for their tenant's recovery?

edit: dollar general is a store that opens in the worst places. they succeed bc not many other businesses want the location so they just take on terrible conditions to serve a consumer that has no options. this is why i think if they fail, there's not many other businesses who would want to rent these locations. walgreens isnt exactly like this, but it has a similar problem.",8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h70q4d/realty_income_reit_hypotetical/
Shares of American Eagle plunge 13% as company issues weak holiday guidance,"American Eagle issued weak holiday guidance on Wednesday and cut its full-year forecast as it contends with value-seeking consumers who are only willing to spend during key shopping moments. 

The apparel retailer narrowly missed Wall Street’s expectations on the top line, but beat on the bottom line. 

Here’s how American Eagle performed during its third fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 48 cents adjusted vs. 46 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $1.29 billion vs. $1.30 billion expected

The company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $80 million, or 41 cents per share, compared with $96.7 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges related to restructuring and impairment costs, American Eagle posted an adjusted profit of 48 cents per share. 

Sales dropped to $1.29 billion, down about 1% from $1.3 billion a year earlier. 

While it was narrow, Wednesday’s miss is the third quarter in a row that American Eagle has not met Wall Street’s sales targets.

Shares dropped about 13% in extended trading.

In a statement, CEO Jay Schottenstein touted a “strong” back-to-school shopping season but said demand remains inconsistent in between major shopping events. 

“We have entered the holiday season well positioned, with our leading brands offering high-quality merchandise, great gifts and an outstanding shopping experience across channels,” Schottenstein said. “Key selling periods have seen a positive customer response, yet we remain cognizant of potential choppiness during non-peak periods.” 

Consumers coming out for key shopping moments, and then sharply dropping off, has been a consistent theme across the retail industry. Foot Locker cited a similar dynamic when reporting earnings earlier on Wednesday, as did Dollar Tree.

For its holiday quarter, American Eagle is expecting comparable sales to be up around 1% with total sales down about 4%, including an $85 million impact from having one less selling week and a later start to the holiday shopping season. The outlook is below the 2.2% comparable sales growth StreetAccount was looking for and the 1% sales decline LSEG had expected. 

As a result, American Eagle is now expecting comparable sales to grow by 3% for the full year, down from prior guidance of 4% growth and below StreetAccount’s estimate of 4.1%. It’s now expecting full-year sales to be up 1%, down from previous guidance of between 2% and 3% and below LSEG expectations of 2.5% growth. 

Similar to other retailers, American Eagle had taken a cautious approach to the back half of the year as it contended with uncertainty around the 2024 election and the overall macroeconomic environment. But unlike its competitors, it has kept that cautious tone.

Both Abercrombie & Fitch and Dick’s Sporting Goods, which issued cautious outlooks earlier this year, reversed their previous mood when reporting earnings earlier this month. 

Despite the underwhelming outlook and sales miss, American Eagle is seeing strong demand for its Aerie brand. Third-quarter revenue for Aerie came in at an all-time high for the company and comparable sales grew 5%, on top of 12% growth from the year-ago period.

"At 36, are these allocations OK?","Since 2025 is close, I’ve been wondering if my investment allocations are still fine. My only goals are to eventually move to Mexico and not work forever.

Allocations:

Roth IRA: 60% FSKAX, 40% VTSAX

Brokerage #1: 100% TSLA (small amount)

Brokerage #2: VMFXX (money market) 64%, VOO 14%

I also have 12 months of expenses saved up since I’m in the oil and gas industry (it’s a rollercoaster). I can probably be Ok with just 6 months of expenses and invest the remainder. I just don’t know what to invest in. Do I just continue with VTSAX/FSKAX or add to VOO? 

I guess I’m just looking to maximize growth. Is there anything you would do differently based on those allocations? I assume the funds in VMFXX should actually be invested instead of just sitting there earning 4.57%..

Downsides of FEPI,"So I just found out about FEPI, and went into a rabbit hole of info on it. Did some math on it, and it seems very volatile, but at the rate of return that it promises (25-27%), it seems like a no brainer. Even if the market crashes by 50% in 2 years, then recovers back to normal in another 2 years, on an initial investment of 10k, you still come out on top.

  
10,000 initial investment

Year 1: 2,500 DIV Yield

Year 2: 1,250 DIV Yield (assuming 50% drop across all tech stocks)

Year 3: 1,250 DIV Yield

Year 4: 2,500 DIV Yield

  
Total returns of almost 19% per year, even in a recession situation. I understand FEPI sells covered calls against the individual stocks and not against the index, so if the underlying tech stocks crash, it will too, but I'm pretty sure tech stocks will recover eventually through any recession (maybe this is the logic preventing others from doing this?)

  
I assume there's something wrong with my thinking, or else everyone would be putting 100k into this instead of any other index fund and calling it a day. 

  
Can anyone give me some more info? ",8,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h6xsx6/downsides_of_fepi/
"'Expects Roku to be bought for a ""large premium"", Ad viewing across programs gives it pricing power' - Needham analyst (Laura Martin)","Needham analyst talking to Bloomberg: 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2024-12-04/needham-sees-acquisition-appeal-for-roku-video

From Interactive Brokers commentary:

> Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterated a Buy rating and $100.00 price target on Roku Inc. ROKU.

> The analyst commented: ""Yesterday, Walmart closed its $2.3B acquisition of Vizio, which was announced in Feb 2024. Walmart's urgent need was driven by AMZN's decision to make all 200mm of its Prime Video subscribers ad- driven in Jan 2024. AMZN then linked its CTV ads to actual purchases made on its site, thereby creating the first RMN (retail media network) with ""closed-loop attribution"". Walmart will now ""fast follow"" AMZN and create a better RMN by tying Vizio's CTV ads to Walmart's online and offline sales.

> We expect Roku to be purchased for a large premium within the next 12 months. We believe that there are several categories of potential purchasers including streamers (NFLX, etc), CTV ad buyers (TTD, etc), retailers (Target, etc), and LLMs (large language models) hungry for billions of new data points daily (AMZN/AWS, MSFT/OpenAI, GOOGL/YouTube/Gemini, etc).

Costco's Extreme PE Ratio,"I have been a long time holder and buyer of Costco's stock, my holdings have preformed considerably well compared with the rest of my portfolio. I was buying Costco stock around 2020-2022 when the PE ratio was around 30-40. Since then the PE has shot up and is quickly approaching 60. The last time Costco had a PE this high was right before the 2000's bubble, it lost 50% of its value over the next couple years. Is Costco still worth buying at a 60 PE ratio? Is Costco doing something different with their business model in 2024 that justifies the PE to almost double from the start of 2024? Are investors starting to get irrational in this market?

"GM expects more than $5 billion impact from China restructuring, including plant closures","General Motors expects a restructuring of its joint venture operations with SAIC Motor Corp. in China to cost more than $5 billion in non-cash charges and writedowns, the Detroit automaker disclosed in a federal filing Wednesday morning.

GM said it expects to write down the value of its joint-venture operations in China by between $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion. It also anticipates another $2.7 billion in charges to restructure the business, including “plant closures and portfolio optimization,” according to the filing.

GM, which previously announced plans to restructure the operations in China, did not disclose any additional details about the expected closures.

“As we have consistently said, we are focused on capital efficiency and cost discipline and have been working with SGM to turn around the business in China in order to be sustainable and profitable in the market. We are close to finalizing our restructuring plan with our partner, and we expect our results in China in 2025 to show year-over-year improvement,” GM said in an emailed statement.

GM said it believes the joint venture “has the ability to restructure without new cash investments” from the American automaker.

A majority of the restructuring costs is expected to be recognized as non-cash, special item charges during the fourth quarter. That means they will impact the automaker’s net income, but not its adjusted earnings before interest and taxes – a key metric monitored by Wall Street.

GM’s operations in China have shifted from a profit engine to liability in the past decade as competition grows from government-backed domestic automakers fueled by nationalism, and as a generational shift in consumer perceptions of the automotive industry and electric vehicles takes hold.

Equity income from GM’s Chinese operations and joint ventures peaked at more than $2 billion in 2014 and 2015.

GM’s market share in China, including its joint ventures, has plummeted from roughly 15% as recently as 2015 to 8.6% last year — the first time it has dropped below 9% since 2003. GM’s equity income from the operations have also fallen, down 78.5% since peaking in 2014, according to regulatory filings.

GM’s U.S.-based brands such as Buick and Chevrolet have seen sales drop more than its joint venture sales with SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors and others. The joint venture models accounted for about 60% of its 2.1 million vehicles sold last year in China.

Prior to this year, the only quarterly losses for GM in China since 2009 were a $167 million shortfall during the first quarter of 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and an $87 million loss during the second quarter of 2022.

The Detroit automaker has reported three consecutive quarterly losses in equity income for its Chinese operations this year, totaling $347 million. That includes a loss of $137 million during the third quarter.

Name a large-cap stock and its small-cap competitor ,"I am always looking for small/mid-cap companies that have a similar business model or product as large cap competitors! 

I’ll start by naming a few (large-cap and small-cap) companies: 

- CRWD and S
- COST and BJ
- KR and SFM
- CMG and CAVA 
- MNST and CELH
- SBUX and BROS 
- Space X and RKLB (count it) 

I always love seeing the small caps slowly take a piece of the pie from the big boys. It’s what capitalism is all about. Especially fun to see when the little guy has a better product. I think this is the case for almost all of the companies I listed. If they aren’t flat out better, they offer something slightly different, or are better in a certain way. 

These smaller cap stocks are obviously a bigger risk, since a lot of them still are not making money, but the growth is very appealing. 

Would love to hear some comparisons like this and an explanation as to why you think the smaller company is better, or will continue to grow. 

Appreciate any responses! The stock market is a wonderful place for some competition. 

Also, it’s my cake-day!",157,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h62rcf/name_a_largecap_stock_and_its_smallcap_competitor/
Protecting Gains on 300 META Shares Without Selling: Selling Deep ITM Calls Strategy,"
I currently hold 300 shares of META that I purchased back in March and have seen decent gains. I want to protect these profits without triggering taxes from selling before the one-year mark (to qualify for long-term capital gains).

I’m considering selling deep in-the-money (ITM) calls with March expiration. These options would expire shortly after my one-year holding period, so my shares would be eligible for long-term capital gains if exercised after expiration.

I understand that selling deep ITM calls could constrain my margin account while the options are open. Aside from that, are there any other risks or pitfalls I should be aware of with this strategy? For example:
	•	Could this strategy be flagged as a “constructive sale” by the IRS?
	•	What happens if the calls are exercised before the March expiration?
	•	Are there better alternatives to hedge while preserving my tax situation?

SCHG vs. SPLG vs. SCHD: Too Much Overlap?,"I’m considering these ETFs for my portfolio: SCHG (growth stocks), SPLG (broad S&P 500), and SCHD (dividend/value focus). I’m worried about overlap—here’s what I’ve found:
	
•	SCHG vs. SPLG: High overlap (~30%-40%) due to shared large-cap growth names like Apple and Microsoft. SPLG is broader but tech-heavy.
	
•	SCHG vs. SCHD: Minimal overlap. SCHG is growth-focused, while SCHD avoids most tech in favor of dividend payers like Pepsi and Coke.
	
•	SPLG vs. SCHD: Moderate overlap; both hold large-cap dividend stocks but differ in sector balance.

Is Nebius / Yandex a pump and dump or is it going to recover up to prewar prices?,"Nebius (NASDAQ:NBIS) shares surged more than 8% on Tuesday as investment firm Citron Research pounded the table on the artificial intelligence-focused technology firm and said CEO Arkady Volozh is ""the real deal.""

""Citron pounding the table that $NBIS is poised to be the next AI Wall Street darling,"" the research firm wrote on the X social network. ""A sleeper with no analyst coverage yet, the market hasn’t caught on to its massive potential—or its undervaluation vs. CoreWeave."" Shares have gained nearly 35% over the past month.

Nebius, which was once known as Yandex before it severed ties with the Russian firm, was likened to cloud service provider Coreweave by Citron, which is likely to go public next year.

""If it trades at a 50% discount to Coreweave multiple that puts $NBIS at $60 (napkin math),"" Citron added, explaining that Nvidia's (NVDA) investment into Nebius was ""not out of the blue.""

ESPN hopes to reach more casual sports fans with Disney+ integration,"ESPN is coming to Disney+. Now, the sports network wants to make sure Disney+ users come to ESPN.

Walt Disney debuted a dedicated ESPN tile Wednesday on Disney+ for people who subscribe to ESPN+, its sports streaming platform, to watch programming without leaving the Disney+ application. Next fall, when ESPN launches its yet-to-be-named “flagship” service, those subscribers will get full access to all ESPN content through the ESPN tile on Disney+.

Disney is making about 100 live games available to Disney+ members without a corresponding ESPN subscription. Those events will span college football and basketball, the National Basketball Association and WNBA, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, tennis, golf, the Little League World Series, and UFC, ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said in an interview.

Next week’s alternate “Simpsons” telecast of the NFL’s “Monday Night Football” game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys will also be available to Disney+ subscribers, as well as five NBA Christmas games.

“Now when you subscribe to Disney+, you’ll have access to kids and family, general entertainment if you’re a Hulu subscriber, and sports,” said Pitaro. “Our goal is to serve sports fans anytime, anywhere.”

ESPN will also include some of its studio programming — such as “College Gameday,” “Pardon the Interruption” and certain podcasts that include video — on Disney+ for non-ESPN subscribers. Some ESPN sports-related films and documentaries will also appear on Disney+ married to whatever sports season is active, Pitaro said.

ESPN’s programming will also be integrated within the Disney+ search, similar to Hulu’s integration earlier this year. If a Disney+ subscriber who isn’t an ESPN customer clicks on something that requires an ESPN subscription, the user will be prompted to sign up within the app.

# New content for Disney+

ESPN is also creating two studio shows specifically for Disney+, Pitaro said. The first will be a daily “SportsCenter” just for Disney+ subscribers, which will air live on Disney+ at a set time and then remain on the platform for on-demand viewing.

The second is a women’s sports show that may air weekly or several times a week. Both programs are in development and will be made for a more casual sports fan, said Pitaro.

“Our research shows there’s very little overlap between people watching Disney+ and ESPN linear,” said Pitaro.

Disney+ has a strong female audience that Pitaro hopes will tune into the weekly’s women’s show, which he first alluded to in an interview with CNBC Sport in October.

ESPN+ has about 30,000 live games each year and costs $11.99 per month when purchased separately from Disney+. A Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ bundle (with ads) costs $16.99 per month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk loses bid to get $56 billion pay package reinstated,"A Delaware judge ruled on Monday that Tesla, CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it.The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker.

Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances, and reinstate his compensation.McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the billions they initially requested.

"Salesforce shares rise after earnings beat on revenue, fourth-quarter guidance","Salesforce shares were up 8% on Tuesday after the company reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings, reporting revenue and fiscal fourth-quarter guidance that exceeded analysts’ expectations.

Here is how the company did compared to what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** $2.41 adjusted vs. $2.44 expected
* **Revenue:** $9.44 billion vs. $9.34 billion expected

The company’s revenue grew 8% year-over-year during the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Its net income was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 25% from $1.2 billion a year ago.

Salesforce said that it is expecting fiscal fourth-quarter sales to come in between $9.90 billion to $10.10 billion. Analysts were projecting $10.05 billion in fourth-quarter sales.

The company said that it expects an earnings per share between the range of $2.57 and $2.62 in the fourth-quarter, compared to analysts’ expectations of $2.65.

Salesforce also raised the low end of its revenue guidance for its fiscal 2025 to come between $37.8 billion and $38 billion. That’s up slightly from $37.7 billion to $38 billion previously. The new range puts the mid point for Salesforce’s fiscal 2025 revenue guidance at $37.9 billion, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $37.86 billion.

“We delivered another quarter of exceptional financial performance across revenue, margin, cash flow, and cRPO,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a statement. “Agentforce, our complete AI system for enterprises built into the Salesforce Platform, is at the heart of a groundbreaking transformation.”

The company in August announced that CFO Amy Weaver would step down from her role as chief financial officer but remain in the position until the company appoints a successor, after which she will become an advisor. That same month, activist investor Starboard Value revealed that it boosted its position in Salesforce by roughly 40% in the second quarter following the firm issuing a letter earlier in the year saying that Salesforce was continuing to move “in the right direction” in regards to improving its profit margin.

Starboard Value released a presentation in October in which it noted that Salesforce “can continue to become more efficient and more profitable.”

Palantir Granted FedRAMP High Baseline Authorization,">Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: PLTR) today announced that it has been granted FedRAMP High Authorization for Palantir Federal Cloud Service (PFCS) and Palantir Federal Cloud Service - Supporting Services (PFCS-SS). These authorizations cover the entirety of Palantir’s product offerings and programs—including AIP, Apollo, Foundry, Gotham, FedStart, and Mission Manager—and therefore enable Palantir to provide any of its product offerings to the U.S. Government at the FedRAMP High baseline.

>FedRAMP is a government-wide program that promotes the adoption of secure cloud services across the federal government by providing a standardized approach to security and risk assessment for cloud technologies and federal agencies. This High authorization builds on Palantir’s previous FedRAMP Moderate and DoD IL5 and IL6 authorizations, and enables the U.S. government to process the most sensitive unclassified workloads in Palantir’s cloud offering.

>“We’re proud to have achieved the FedRAMP High milestone for our full product suite, including our award-winning AI Platform (AIP), which is transforming the speed, scale, and efficiency with which the US Government can operate across civilian, defense, and intelligence agencies. With the addition of the PFCS-SS FedRAMP High offering, Palantir is excited to accelerate our work with other technology partners—big and small, government or commercial—to enable their technology to be securely operated on behalf of USG missions,” said Akash Jain, CTO and President of Palantir USG. “This milestone is an affirmation of our ongoing commitment to upholding the highest security standards and being trusted to handle our government partners’ most sensitive data and workloads, as well as our commitment to enabling the entire American technology base to support critical government needs.”

The margin for United health is 5%. Most insurance companies have a similar margin. Retailers like Walmart have a margin of 3%.

This publicly verifiable information seems to contradict the prevailing narrative of corporations price gouging does it not?
If United make a profit of $5 for every 100 in premiums it receives, then even if they were a non profit and passed all savings to consumers the price of health care insurance would only go down 5%. In the case of walmart your $100 grocery bill would go down to $97.

Rivians everywhere I look! ,"I know this is anecdotal, and not a good reason to invest, but I have been seeing Rivians everywhere lately. I decided to do a little digging. 

Rivian's sales were up 71% compared to Q1 2023. The company has been ramping up production, although it has faced some challenges due to supply chain issues. Rivian has adjusted its delivery targets for 2024 to between 50,500 and 52,000 vehicles.

I understand that they have been struggling to make a profit, which definitely cannot be overlooked. But, there is no denying that the demand is there. The backing is also there. Volkswagen has invested in Rivian. In 2024, Volkswagen announced an investment of up to $5 billion in Rivian, with the goal of developing next-generation electric vehicle architecture and software technology. The two companies formed a joint venture to collaborate on this project.

The stock has been sitting in the 10-15 dollar range the last 6 months. It seems to me that the market is waiting for it to break one way or another. If it breaks to the upside I could see a lot of people that have been waiting on the sidelines hop on board. 

This is just my quick two cents on the stock. Would love to hear everyone’s else’s opinion. I decided to throw 100 dollars on it as a fun bet. I’m definitely routing for them. I think their trucks looks really cool, and I love the new cars in the pipeline.

Super Micro Computer pops 15% after special committee finds no ‘evidence of misconduct’,"Super Micro Computer surged more than 14% after a special committee ruled that it found “no evidence of misconduct” at the embattled AI server maker, and appointed a new chief accounting officer.

“The evidence reviewed by the Special Committee did not raise any substantial concerns about the integrity of Supermicro’s senior management or Audit Committee, or their commitment to ensuring that the Company’s financial statements are materially accurate,” the company said in a release.

Super Micro said it’s also currently searching for a new chief financial officer, and looking to fill additional financial leadership positions. The company appointed current Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller Kenneth Cheung as its chief accounting officer.

The news from Super Micro Computer comes on the heels of a volatile year for the company. Shares sank in August after Hindenburg Research revealed a short position in the company, saying that it found “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation” and the company delayed the release of its annual filing.

Those troubles continued, with Ernst & Young resigning as the company’s auditor in October due to concerns about the board’s governance and independence. Shares are up about 30% this year, after giving back much of its rally. Last month, the company averted a potential delisting from the Nasdaq following its monster plunge.

Among the findings, the committee ruled that the conclusions reached by Ernst & Young in its resignation were “not supported by the facts” and that the firm’s audit committee exhibited “appropriate independence and generally provided proper oversight.”

The special committee consisted of Super Micro’s board, counsel from Cooley LLP and a team from forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors.

I Want to Hear Your Thoughts on the Qualities Intel’s Next CEO Should Have and Why,"With Pat Gelsinger retiring, the company is once again searching for a CEO who can steer it through its challenges.

Who do you think Intel needs next as CEO, and why? Should it be an insider with deep technical expertise or someone from outside with a fresh perspective? How do you think the leadership transition will unfold in the coming months/years?

Here’s a quick summary of Intel’s past CEOs, their departures, and the criticisms they faced, for reference:  


|**CEO**|**Predecessor's Reason for Departure**|**Public Criticism or Perceived Failures**|**Successor’s Key Attributes**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Pat Gelsinger**|Bob Swan replaced due to lack of technical background|Struggled to regain process leadership; delays in 7nm; stiff competition from AMD and TSMC|Deep technical expertise, Intel veteran, proven leader at VMware|
|**Bob Swan**|Brian Krzanich resigned after a policy violation|Failed to address manufacturing delays; lacked vision to compete with AMD/ARM-based chips|Stability-focused leader with strong financial acumen|
|**Brian Krzanich**|Paul Otellini retired citing personal reasons|Poor handling of mobile market diversification; failed to anticipate ARM dominance|Manufacturing and operations expertise, Intel insider|
|**Paul Otellini**|Craig Barrett retired as part of a planned transition|Missed opportunities in mobile chips, allowing Qualcomm and ARM to dominate|Strategic thinker, strong marketing and client focus|
|**Craig Barrett**|Andrew Grove stepped down after transforming Intel|Slow diversification beyond PCs; overexposure to dot-com volatility|Deep engineering and manufacturing expertise|

**Questions to consider**:

* What should Intel prioritize in its next CEO: technical skills, operational expertise, or a focus on profitability?
* What qualities or background should this leader have to address Intel's challenges?
* How do you think this transition will impact Intel’s market position and stock performance?

Let’s look back in the future to see how close we were!",0,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h691u7/i_want_to_hear_your_thoughts_on_the_qualities/

GM to sell stake in battery cell plant to joint venture partner for roughly $1 billion,"General Motors plans to sell its stake in a $2.6 billion electric vehicle battery cell plant in Michigan to its joint venture partner LG Energy Solution, the automaker announced Monday.

The Detroit carmaker said it expects to recoup its investment in the facility, which a source familiar with the plans said is anticipated to be roughly $1 billion. The sale is part of a non-binding agreement between the two companies that’s anticipated to close during the first quarter of next year, GM said.

The nearly completed, 2.8 million-square-foot plant in Lansing, Michigan, was expected to be the third battery cell facility of the joint venture, known as Ultium Cells LLC, following plants in Ohio and Tennessee that have already opened and are operational.

The Lansing plant was announced in January 2022, and the two companies first announced their joint venture five years ago.

GM’s move comes as the automaker attempts to right-size production of electric vehicles and confronts slower-than-expected consumer demand. It also comes amid uncertainty regarding federal incentives for manufacturing and purchasing EVs in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump.

The automaker said the sale does not impact its overall ownership stake in the joint venture or its future plans for a separate joint venture plant with LGES rival Samsung SDI.

“We believe we have the right cell and manufacturing capabilities in place to grow with the EV market in a capital efficient manner,” GM CFO Paul Jacobson said in a release. “When completed, this transaction will also help LG Energy Solution meet demand by leveraging capacity that’s nearly ready to come online and it will make GM even more efficient.” 

GM said the South Korean battery supplier will have immediate access to the Lansing facility to begin installation of equipment. The plant, which currently employs nearly 100 people, was expected to begin operating by the end of this year.

Separate from the sale of its stake in the Lansing facility, GM on Monday announced it will extend a 14-year battery technology partnership with LGES to include the development of an emerging type of battery cell called prismatic cells.

Prismatic cells are a flat, rectangular shape with a rigid enclosure, which allows for space-efficient packaging within battery modules and packs. GM said the cells are expected to reduce EV weights and costs, while simplifying manufacturing by reducing the number of modules and mechanical components.

“We’re focused on optimizing our battery technology by developing the right battery chemistries and form factors to improve EV performance, enhance safety, and reduce costs. By extending our partnership with LG Energy Solution, we’re taking an important step towards these goals,” Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery cell and pack, said in a release.

GM had previously said it planned to expand its battery cell technologies from its flat “Ultium” pouches to include other forms such as prismatic cells.

"""Existencial question"" about common stocks.","Let's suppose that a few financial analysts have evaluated the intrinsic value of the shares of company X. By ""intrinsic"", I mean not only the value of the company underlying assets (tangible and intangible) minus liabilities but also any other type of fundamental analysis. By consensus, the intrinsic value was estimated at $1 per share.

However, the market value is $0.70. In other words, the stock is being sold at a discount. Is there any kind of arbitrage that forces the market price to converge towards the intrinsic value? I haven't yet found any reason that would encourage the increase in the market price beyond the usual speculation. Even if the stock has an intrinsic value of $1, shareholders cannot liquidate it outside the secondary market...

Arbitrage in derivatives markets is easier to understand. Suppose the market price of gold is M. To secure this price in the future, an investor can buy a gold call option at a price P (strike price), where M = P on the date of purchase of the option. After some time, the market price of gold is M+N. Consequently, the option has gained a value of N, that is: it can be sold directly for N to another investor. Even if there is no liquidity in the derivatives market to sell the option for N, the investor can exercise the right to buy gold for P and sell the gold in the spot market for M+N. From this exercise, he would obtain the same N.

In the equity market, I don't see a similar way for an investor to liquidate the intrinsic value of the stock. It doesn't make much sense either. So, there's only speculation left. If that's really the case, it's quite problematic. As a famous economist said: ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""",0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h61ksu/existencial_question_about_common_stocks/
Can someone please explain the process of reclaiming stocks that were escheated?,"Hi guys. If you could please help me out i’d be very grateful. My grandmother passed recently. My father, who was her POA found some stock certificates (old paper ones) for GE ranging from 25-35 years ago.  

She got dementia 3 or 4 years ago and forgot all the details of her life. I was told to have my dad call the share owner services which he did. The only info they would give is that my grandmothers account or stocks are “inactive”.  That’s the only info other than if he wanted more information he has to mail copy of death certificate, POA form , etc. 


If what i found on google is correct , it sounds like the stocks were escheated, but we don’t know the next step from there. She lived in CT and FL, then back to CT after she got sick.

Costco tariffs coming to a store near you! ,"I love Costco, the stores are awesome and they have everything but i feel the stock has gotten out of control.

The PE is 59! you are paying $59 for every $1 they earn. Thats just irresponsible investing.

They are expanding across Asia but they are also facing stiff competition from home base Chinese companies. And one thing china is very good at: copying everyone else and selling stuff for cheap to eliminate competition. Im not saying Costco will fail but it wont be easy for them outside the US.

Lastly we have the tariff situation. The proposition is a 10% tariff on Chinese goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. This is a bit of a problem because Costco is the #12 importer in the US for 2024. Most common origin is China. Walmart got smart and started to protect themselves and reducing Chinese imports but Costco and their business model, will have a much harder time navigating with keeping the prices attractive.

All their top trading partners are Chinese companies.

Costco sells ALOT of electronics and appliances, its one of their biggest categories. If a TV cost $1000 today, staring Jan 20th(day one in office) it will cost $1600. Appliances going up $100's of dollars is hyper inflation and people are already stretched thin going into the holidays.

Im really looking forward to this upcoming earnings release and how they will guide going forward. I guarantee you all the analyst questions will be about tariffs and profit margins.

Costco's profit margin for fiscal 2023 was 2.6%. Costco's profit margin for 2024 was 2.9%. They can only raise the membership and prices so much before people starting shopping elsewhere. ",0,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h62nju/costco_tariffs_coming_to_a_store_near_you/

Anyone else buying the NU dip?,"I’ve been an investor in NU for a while now. I firmly believe the market is panic selling because Warren Buffet sold 19% of his stake in the company.

Today the company is down again because Citi bank downgraded its rating on NU to a sell.

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

Do you guys agree?

~
EDIT:

(Thanks for all your thoughts. I’ve realized there are a few key things I overlooked.

I previously thought the stock was heavily owned by retail investors, similar to SoFi’s stock. I naively assumed this because the stock is frequently discussed on social media. Due to this preconceived notion, I believed the stock price would be significantly influenced by analyst ratings. I still think a large number of people have started to sell because of Warren Buffett reducing his stake and Citi’s sell recommendation. However, I now see that the primary factors driving this downturn are geopolitical and economic risks in Brazil.

My updated assessment is that the stock is being sold for a few very valid reasons. Firstly, Brazil’s inflation has been rising over the past few quarters. Secondly, Donald Trump has threatened BRICS nations with 100% tariffs if they decide to create a currency to rival the U.S. dollar. Thirdly, Warren Buffett sold 19% of his stake in the company. Fourthly, the value of Brazil’s currency has been declining and recently hit historic lows compared to the U.S. dollar. Finally, Brazil’s government spending was recently cut, potentially signaling a slowdown in their economy.

Overall, people are very concerned about the economic and geopolitical risks surrounding NU, especially since it is a Brazilian company. Brazil has a historically unstable economy and is currently facing economic headwinds that are amplified by the risk of potential tariffs.

I’m taking a cautious approach from here on out. I won’t be selling any shares, but I also won’t be buying more until the stock price consolidates and the Brazilian economy stabilizes.

I’m still very bullish on NU because the company has grown unbelievably fast in just 11 years. They survived Brazil’s economic collapse in 2014–2016, and they also weathered the last round of U.S. tariffs on Brazil in 2018. I believe NU will continue to expand rapidly into other Latin American countries, which will reduce its exposure to Brazilian tariffs and economic challenges. The CEO and management team are extremely competent, and I believe in their ability to navigate these challenges in the long term.

The worst-case scenario would be if the BRICS nations successfully create a new currency. Even then, I still believe NU will be okay due to its expansion into other markets. For now, I’m holding and remain very bullish on the business.)",26,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4wyxh/anyone_else_buying_the_nu_dip/
Is anyone else a little concerned about this market jump up?,"Listen, I get that it seems like clear skies and rainbows, and I’m not really a “bearish” type investor, but sometimes I find it good practice to sit back for a moment and just reevaluate the current situation we’re in.

I’ll give an example that pertains to me. I’m currently invested in Sofi, PLTR, and RKLB, so this has been an incredible year for me. But looking back, it’s starting to really feel like total and utter exuberance again like 2021. YouTube videos and subreddits have been saying over and over how this is only the beginning and we’re going to be at 500 next year. That’s exactly the type of shit that was said in 2021 right before every small cap stock tanked like 70%. 

I’m not saying it’s a time to sell, I would personally prescribe to the “it’s time to slow down on how much I invest” currently. Buying RKlb at 27$ or PLTR at 66$ is not the same opportunity as in the 4-7$ range as it used to be. It seems very difficult to find any good deals, considering literally almost every sector in the stock market is just going up vertically. And just remember, just it is a great company doesn’t always mean it’s currently a good price to buy it. Sometimes it’s good to take the foot off the breaks when stocks going up 300%+ in one year.

But hey what do I know. Just be careful out there folks, and don’t get sucked too hard into the FOMO. Be fearful when everyone else is greedy and all that jazz.",535,462,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h49py3/is_anyone_else_a_little_concerned_about_this/

I predict Apple will acquire Nissan in the next 18 months,"The Japanese automaker is facing severe financial challenges and may run out of cash within 12 months, putting it on the brink of bankruptcy.

Apple, with its bold ambitions to enter the electric vehicle (EV) market, has already invested over $10 billion in R&D for the Apple Car. Despite canceling the project earlier this year, that investment exceeds Nissan's current valuation.

Partnering with Nissan could help Apple overcome the manufacturing hurdles it faced with its EV project. Nissan has proven expertise, having produced the Nissan Leaf, the best-selling non-Tesla EV of all time.

The global EV market is one of the fastest-growing industries, projected to double by 2030. By acquiring Nissan, Apple could transform its vehicles into sleek, cutting-edge products that seamlessly integrate into the Apple ecosystem.

Broadcom expects AI revenue to reach $12 billion in fiscal 2024, accounting for less than 25% of total revenue.

Custom AI chips are at the core of Broadcom is AI revenues, accounting for up to two-thirds of the total, driven primarily through partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, AWS, and Google.

Customized chips are expected to play a more important role over the next five years, helping customers address AI cluster scaling and cost challenges.

Broadcom is leadership in the networking market could be challenged by NVIDIA, which is capturing the market with more competitive networking solutions.

Broadcom is growth in AI, while promising, is still a low percentage of overall revenue from AI.

Weakness in the non-AI revenue segment could undermine the market's bullish confidence in Broadcom.

Wall Street is constructive on Broadcom, but future guidance needs to remain strong to maintain market confidence.

Broadcom is forward-looking PEG ratio of 1.69 is attractive compared to the tech sector average of 1.89.

I think attention needs to be paid to the company's execution in AI and potential headwinds in non-AI businesses.

On balance, Broadcom stock is under short-term pressure, but the long-term bullish logic remains in place for investors who are optimistic about AI growth prospects.

What do we think about IOVA?,"Firstly congrats everyone on RKLB, ACHR and LUNR gains. It was fun ride, I have to be honest I had jumped off the wagon a bit earlier but hat off to all of you that mooned! 

Also for some of you that jumped on ZETA, enjoy the good days that await. 

But let’s talk about IOVA…:

Another biopharma stock trying to solve the issues of cancer. An industry that is a Holy Grail for all pump and dumpers out here. 

But is this one different? To be honest I do not know, but that is why I am posting this. To hear other sides, other points of view. 

IOVA is currently sitting around $9. These are levels of before the this year run to $16 (what goes up must come down, when pumped and dumped). However… this company reported revenues, 90.86mil revenue to be precise. Granted, not enough to support current market cap but bear in mind it is bio industry we talk about. It takes 1 approval and it is too late.

Leadership:
CEO is there since 2016, seems like an experienced guy. Was contributor to many oncology drugs already developed and approved.

Others seem legit as well, this post is already too long… feel free to research yourself.

They also own a bit less than 12% so there is certain commitment there.  And of course the vanguard, black rock etc. are heavily involved as well. More than 87% is owned by institutions. 

Amtagvi product got approved by FDA and that is now generating certain revenue. They plan tk get approval in Canada, Europe and UK as well. 

They also work on LN-145, IOV-4001 and IOV-3001 but let’s be honest these are long shots and nothing guarantee success of these.

I know these are speculations and putting some numbers from the future is no way to go but I feel like I have to just to make this post a bit more complete.

Potential yearly revenue if approved broader and if nothing goes wrong  is 12billion (amount of people with cancer of specific type * cost of treatment) but realistic values at beginning is 1-2bill per year or even less. 

And then for all the gamblers time that with moon if other drugs get approved as well. 

Company with 90mil revenue and 80 million of debt with 2,8 billion market cap and 440 million of operating expenses. Company with future (on the moon or in the sand). Do you hate IOVA or you will become a bag holder?

Seeking Alpha Black Friday Sale,"Is it just me, or does the Seeking Alpha Black Friday sale seem extremely unremarkable? They raised their price from $239 to $299 a year a few months ago, then when Black Friday comes they make the ""Sale"" the $239 price. What a deal, eh?

I recently got WSJ/Barrons/Marketwatch/IBD for $7 a month. Yahoo Finance's free version is basically Seeking Alpha lite. FastGraphs normal price is what Seeking Alpha is charging as their ""sale"" price.

What caused their inflationary pricing to go up so much for Seeking Alpha? Importing tech from China increased? Midwest farmers crops went bad and they jacked the price up?

Their subscription price has doubled in the last 3 years. To me, it just shows they have no problem giving their customers the middle finger while taking as much as they can from them.

The defense Sector - Can those Earnings be sustained in peace times. ,"T hasn't made it to the white house yet and he's already cleaning house and arranging furniture, meeting with heads of state as if he's really running things. He's lucky Elon is right there next to him doing the heavy lifting to make things more - efficient.

It got me wondering about the defense sector. The pentagon has failed every audit for the last several years which leads me to believe all these defense contractors are getting kick backs off the books but also their contracts might be over inflated and they taking advantage of Uncle Sam's check book because he doesn't really know what hes signing off on.

Its possible the Dept of Justice might sue them to pay back their, corrupt pricing over the years.

The other factor is Jan 20th inauguration day. Trump clearly said he's not paying a dollar more to Ukraine, so that means billions of dollars is no longer going to flow to the bottom line. Hezbollah and Israel signed a deal. So things are staring to look more peaceful. Zelensky said he might be willing to make concessions on land to make peace.

So the question is, are defense contractors overvalued?

I just don't think they'll be able to sustain earnings like the last two years. The spending will drastically slow.",0,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h4xd4y/the_defense_sector_can_those_earnings_be/
German market - Volkswagen,"I started investing in stock market around 8 years ago and at that time I only did that through my bank in my European country. Time passing and all these broker apps did it so much easier to invest in stock market and NYSE seemed so appealing, that I totally forgot about other markets the last years.
So here I am today, checking German market and specifically Volkswagen and I cannot figure out why is it so much undervalued. I mean look at this EBITDA and cash on hand.
Is there something I missing of? Do you think Trump can hurt Europe that much? Did whole Europe stop investing in European countries? Do you think that German auto manufacturers don’t worth their value?

difference between splitting large companies by FTC/DoJ  and collaborating companies,"Not sure is this is just obvious and a stupid question.

For example, Musk seems to use X data to train models of xAI even if they are separate companies or uses Tesla employees to fix X stuff or spaceX stuff, it doesn't seem like the government stops companies from collaborating.

Thoughts on buying BRB.K this month instead of DCAing into S&P?,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

Thanks. ",78,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2nht8/thoughts_on_buying_brbk_this_month_instead_of/
Fellow Canadians: What’s the Difference Between ZSP and VFV?,"I’ve been looking into Canadian ETFs and came across ZSP (BMO S&P 500 Index ETF) and VFV (Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF). Both track the S&P 500, which is appealing to me because I want exposure to the U.S. market, but I’m trying to understand the differences between these two funds in more depth.

On the surface, they look very similar: both are Canadian-domiciled ETFs that hold U.S. equities and are traded on the TSX. They both offer exposure to the same underlying index, so their holdings should be nearly identical. However, I noticed a few potential areas where they might differ:

**MER (Management Expense Ratio)**: ZSP and VFV have slightly different MERs. Does the lower MER really make a noticeable difference over the long term, or is it more of a ""nice to have""?

**Tracking Error**: Are there any known differences in how closely these funds track the S&P 500? Are there any instances where one deviated more significantly than the other?

**Liquidity and Trading Spreads**: For someone who might not be buying or selling huge quantities, are there noticeable differences in the bid-ask spreads? Do they trade with similar liquidity, or does one tend to have an advantage?

**Currency Hedging**: From what I understand, neither of these funds is hedged to CAD. Is there any other nuance to their handling of currency that I should be aware of?

**Dividend Treatment**: Both distribute dividends, but does one reinvest them differently or handle U.S. withholding tax in a way that might make it more or less tax-efficient?

**Historical Performance**: Have you noticed any meaningful differences in performance between these two over the years? Even if minor, what could explain the difference if the index they track is identical?

Lastly, I’d love to hear what you personally use and why. Are there specific scenarios where ZSP might be better than VFV or vice versa? Is it purely a matter of brand loyalty (Vanguard vs. BMO), or are there more practical considerations?

I'm also curious about how either fits into a broader portfolio. If you’re holding one of these, are you pairing it with other U.S. exposure like QQQ, or do you lean heavily on Canadian equities like VCN for balance?

Any insights, opinions, or anecdotes would be super helpful! Thanks in advance for helping me make sense of these two ETFs.",12,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2wlob/fellow_canadians_whats_the_difference_between_zsp/
Ocean Exploration Stocks! The next big sector! ,"In my opinion, ocean exploration stocks are heavily overlooked. With only about 5% of the ocean explored, there are so many unknowns and promising possibilities. 

Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and underwater drones is an emerging technology that I have been keeping a close eye on. This technology will make things like resource exploration, climate change research, scientific research, technological advancements and marine conservation more feasible. The are key factors that will drive growth in this sector the next 5-10 years. 

Currently there are a lot of ocean exploration companies that already have solid revenue streams from oil and gas industries and underwater infrastructure like pipelines and umbilicals. I think these current revenue streams will continue to thrive. And future revenue streams are right around the corner. 

Costs of exploration have been the biggest hurdle in this sector, but as technology continues to advance, costs have been quickly dwindling, making more and more projects feasible. 

Companies that I have recently been researching are: OII and TDY. Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on these companies, and am excited to hear about other companies you find promising in this sector. 

Side note: I believe that there is a super-intelligent species living in the ocean that we don’t know about yet. Let’s try to find them ;). ",0,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h3i51d/ocean_exploration_stocks_the_next_big_sector/
Technology and its effect on stock market average returns. Does the future hold higher average returns?,"I know, I know.......I know. NO ONE knows what the market will do other than it will go up, down or sideways.

But I feel like we live in a different world now than we did the past numerous decades. Everyone has access to investing. Right in the palm of their hands. Virtually anyone anywhere can invest in any market they wish from their phone. Historical returns are 7 percent (inflation adjusted) based on old technology, processes, access and education on finance. It is no longer the days of old where tie wearing NYSE brokers answer their rotary phones screaming about deals and brokering deals for end user. It was a whole process and really, you NEEDED someone to strike the deals for you and in most cases, suggest what funds to invest in since there was no internet to self educate or even research companies to invest in.

Nowadays with giants like Fidelity, Vanguard and others offering index funds that take all of the thought and most of the choice and a lot of the risk out of the equation. I don't need to ask a broker which SP500 fund to buy. I don't need a broker to strike deals for me. I don't even need to make a call or have a person do ANYTHING for me.

I am not a crypto investor, I am a naysayer in fact. But I cannot deny the effect that crypto has had on investing. It has done a LOT to make investing mainstream, if not even trendy. There were always hedge funds and major investors but now regular consumers are taking part and making retail a MUCH bigger player. Retail tripled almost instantly in 2020 and participation has remained high.

Almost all of the hurdles have been removed between the investor and the investment with technology. There is little to understand/learn and is done anywhere, any time for convenience. Not a fan of robinhood but apps like this have put the keys to investing directly into the end users hands.

Now that investing is automatically diversified, exceptionally well returning index funds are in the palm of everyone's hand, consider that the US stock market is the economic powerhouse of the world. Anyone anywhere for the most part can invest in US stock market. This is appealing to anyone in a lesser financial climate (Japan). Now that the wealth gluttons have their claws in every last corner of US government, I don't see them doing anything but moves to further bolster financial and economic markets. The US stock market is the harvesting field of the elite wealth gluttons.

My personal thoughts though as I said, I am aware NO ONE can predict the stock market. But it feels poised to redefine ""average returns"" and with the near future political climate.....if it doesn't get completely blown up (unlikely) I think future returns will far exceed 7 percent as long as the USA remains the economic powerhouse that it is",19,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2ppqn/technology_and_its_effect_on_stock_market_average/
Reddit overtakes X in popularity of social media platforms in UK $RDDT,"[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/28/reddit-overtakes-x-in-popularity-of-social-media-platforms-in-uk)

Reddit, the American online discussion platform, has overtaken X to become the fifth most popular social media platform in the UK, according to the communications watchdog.

Ofcom said Reddit, where users post on discussion threads within topic-based communities, was visited by 22.9 million UK adults in May this year, compared with 22.1 million on X.

The figures make Reddit the fastest-growing large social media platform in the UK and represent a growth of 47% on the same period in 2023. The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook [Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.

Reddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google’s search engine this year.

Farhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: “Google’s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.”

Ofcom also speculated that the change may have been caused [by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit’s stock market flotation in March this year.

The popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its [takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal) but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X [launched by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).

The Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog’s annual report into the nation’s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.

The misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is “significant evidence” of electoral fraud in the UK.

The regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence.",1053,166,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1x2aj/reddit_overtakes_x_in_popularity_of_social_media/

The evolution of an investor - Which level are you?,"I believe there’s a common journey (or evaluation) of an investor. We all start by knowing absolutely nothing about analyzing companies or investing in general, but we get better over time, as we accumulate knowledge and experience.

**Level 1: The Noob**

At this level, the focus is solely on the **share price and its past performance**. So, when the share price goes down from $100 to $30, the noob investor would conclude that now, the stock is cheap and buying is the right thing to do. Of course, this doesn’t have to be the case. In fact, public companies that went bankrupt went on exactly this trajectory. There are plenty of reasons why the share price could collapse, and this decline could be justified. However, the noob investor isn’t aware that there are many questions that one should ask.

In addition, at this level, there’s a **tendency to follow the crowd and the opinion of others**, which is often times a really bad idea. However, without any knowledge and experience, the opinions of others oftentimes sound logical and smart.

**Level 2: The Enthusiast**

The enthusiast has heard that **there’s more to investing than just the share price**. You’ve started exploring financial statements, and you’re learning the basics of accounting. **For the first time, the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement start making sense**. I’m sure everyone can recall that time when you could read the financial statements and understand what they meant. It comes with a confidence boost, and it is normal to think “*Ah, I’ve got this investing thing figured out. It’s easy!*”

The catch is – even though it feels like a superpower, this is still the beginning. Financial statements provide information about what happened, not what will happen. Understanding them is useful, but not enough to be a great investor.

But at least now, you can actually challenge some of the opinions of others.

**Level 3: The Seeker**

This is where one is moving beyond the basics. Now you’ve learned that there are **various valuation techniques**, that allow you to figure out what a company is worth. It gets exciting! This is where you get introduced to the EBITDA and P/E multiples, relative valuation, dividend discount model, and DCF. All of these can be powerful tools, and they’re one piece of the puzzle to understand if a company is undervalued or not. At some point, you will likely stick with one or two models that work best for you.

But here’s the problem. Having the tools isn’t the same as knowing how to use them. At this stage, it is common to have fancy spreadsheets with inputs that aren’t supported in any meaningful way other than historical financial data. Basically, **garbage in – garbage out**. You might not be aware of the disadvantages that come with the various models and fall into some of the common traps.

However, it doesn’t feel that way. When you spend hours gathering data and filling in your inputs, **it feels like a new superpower**, because in the end, there is an output. You have estimated the value of a company, and now you can compare that with the market price.

But, if your assumptions about growth rates, the discount rate, or margins are significantly off, your valuation is meaningless. In fact, there’s a chance it harms you more than it helps you.

By the way, everything that I’ve mentioned until now can be 100% automated. So, up until this level, you have no advantage over a relatively simple algorithm.

**Level 4: The Thinker**

At this point, you understand how important the inputs are.

Therefore, the focus shifts a bit more towards **understanding the industry, and the broader environment**, and asking the right questions so that the input is more solid.

For example, if you are analyzing a car company, you might want to understand if there’s a trend regarding EVs, if there are any regulatory changes that will impact your margins, if the company needs to invest more to expand its capacity, etc.

This is when **research becomes your best friend**. You’re no longer just looking at the company in isolation—you’re connecting the dots between the company, its competitors, and the broader environment. Storytelling also becomes a part of your process, as now you’re not just crunching numbers—you’re building a narrative about the company’s future.

**Level 5: The Pro**

This is the pinnacle of investing and where intangibles come into play.

I don’t mean goodwill and patents. I mean **the management team and the company’s culture**. The key questions here are:

* Is the management trustworthy?
* What is its track record?
* What is its vision?
* Is there a culture that can survive tough times?

Culture is an often-overlooked factor in investing, but it’s incredibly important. As the saying goes, 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast.' A company with a strong culture can attract and retain top talent which is a must for being a great company.

What I find interesting is, that if you are to invest in a private company, you’d get to level 5 sooner than if you invest in public companies.

Here’s an example. Imagine someone walks up to you, and offers you to invest $10k in his company, and in exchange, you’ll have 10% of it. The first question that you’ll have is: Who is this person? If the person in question was someone you know for bad behavior, misleading friends and family, and many failed ventures, you probably have your answer already, and the idea is irrelevant.

However, if it was someone you knew who has integrity and many successful ventures, then you’d probably continue the conversation by asking questions about the idea itself. Your goal would be to understand the business, whether it can survive in the environment, and what return can you expect from it.

I hope you enjoyed this post and wish you great success on your investing journey! Do you recognize these levels in your own progression?

Which level resonates with you the most—and what steps will you take to reach the next one? Share your thoughts in the comments—I’d love to hear your story!",0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h38kyf/the_evolution_of_an_investor_which_level_are_you/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I think bird flu risk is being underestimated by the market. Long on $MRNA,"So far H5N1 has been slowly making it’s way from chickens to cows (around the middle of 2024) and now pigs in Oregon (within the last couple weeks). There have been a few mild human cases, basically all in farm workers working closely with infected animals. Although there was at least one case recently where they had no idea where the patient got infected from.

Normally, CDC will be tracking all this and keeping tabs on isolation of infected communities/individuals. This flu seems to be most prevalent in the US than other countries so far, and we have much more transparency and observability than China. So my risk assessment for this has been pretty low until Trump got elected.

But Trump has been making it very very clear that he’s going to pull every stop to deport undocumented migrants. Most of the people working in shitty conditions in farms are…undocumented. Undocumented workers are normally able to access some level of public services like healthcare, but this is about to get completely shut down by the Trump admin. And these farm workers are about to get shoved into concentrated compartments with really poor hygiene conditions, and it’s going to take a long time for them to actually get processed and deported. Many will run and hide, and that will also end up hiding how many people are actually infected and spreading the disease.

I think most people are expecting the Trump admin, especially under RFK Jr.'s health dept, to reduce spending on vaccines. But I think at a certain point, the rhetoric is bound to change, as more and more people get bird flu. After all, Operation Warp Speed was under the last Trump administration as well.

Moderna was given $176 million in July by the HHS to develop an mRNA bird flu vaccine. There already exists a bird flu vaccine made by CSL Seqirus, but I would imagine that the Trump administration will want to call upon a well-known American company to manufacture ""America first"" vaccines.

$MRNA has been down for many months, as the COVID hype worn down, but they [recently announced](https://www.biospace.com/business/moderna-slashes-r-d-budget-by-1-1b-eyes-10-approvals-through-2027) that they are reducing R&D expenses and focusing on 10 approvals by 2027.

"TSMC seems cheap to me, what’s your opinion?","
Key stats today: Forward P/E 17.6x, PEG 0.6x, P/FCF 23.7x, EV/EBITDA 10.1x, Consensus target price $1390.43 compared to current price of $1005.00, Implied upside 38.4%. (source Factset as of 11/27/2024)

Investment thesis: The surge in AI applications has significantly increased demand for TSMC’s advanced chips. In Q3 2024, net profit rose 54% year-over-year to NT$325.3 billion (US$10.1 billion), exceeding forecasts. AI-related products are expected to contribute 15% of TSMC’s revenue in 2024, up from 5% in 2023. TSMC plans to commence mass production of 2-nanometer chips in Taiwan by 2025, maintaining its competitive edge. 
TSMC is diversifying its manufacturing footprint with significant investments in the U.S. and Japan. In Arizona, TSMC is constructing fabs expected to begin production between 2025 and the decade’s end. In Japan, TSMC, in partnership with Sony, opened a chip plant in February 2024 and plans a second facility by 2027.

Question about selling and purchase again in less than 30 days Taxes. ,"Hello, I have a question. If I buy 1,000 shares of XYZ at $10 and then sell them for $6, can I use the $4,000 loss for tax purposes
But if the stock continues to fall and before 30 days have passed since I sold it, I buy it again at $4 per share and after a while I sell it at $7??

How count this??? Loss $4000, Gain $3000 = -$1000

What would happen in that case? And if instead of selling it at $7, I hold it longer and end up selling it for more than the $10 I originally paid?

PayPal: A Path Back to Its Historical Strength and Growth Potential,"PayPal, once a darling of the fintech space, has seen its valuation contract significantly over the past few years. With its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently hovering around 20, the stock is far below its historical average of 43. A return to that average, driven by projected earnings of $5.71 per share by 2025, would imply a stock price north of $246—an opportunity that many investors might be overlooking. But for PayPal to reclaim its historical valuation, much must fall into place.

The foundation of PayPal’s future lies in its strategic initiatives, beginning with the integration of its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD). Introduced in 2023, PYUSD is more than just another digital currency; it is PayPal’s bridge to the future of blockchain-powered commerce. Unlike many failed stablecoin experiments, PYUSD is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries, giving it the stability and trustworthiness needed to thrive. The potential for PYUSD to facilitate global cross-border payments and power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications is immense. PayPal’s ability to capitalize on this innovation could redefine its relevance in the financial ecosystem.

Beyond cryptocurrency, PayPal is making waves with a growing advertising business that has largely flown under the radar. By leveraging its immense trove of transactional data from over 400 million active users, the company is building a platform that allows merchants to create highly targeted and effective marketing campaigns. This advertising arm, though still in its early stages, has the potential to generate billions in annual revenue. Even modest success here could have a significant impact on PayPal’s top line, creating another compelling growth driver.

Innovation has always been at the heart of PayPal’s strategy, and recent developments like the Fastlane checkout system showcase its commitment to staying ahead. This one-click guest checkout feature, paired with partnerships with major platforms like Shopify and Fiserv, enhances the company’s offerings for merchants and consumers alike. Meanwhile, initiatives like the CashPass rewards program deepen user engagement and loyalty, ensuring that PayPal remains a go-to solution for everyday transactions.

Leadership will play a critical role in PayPal’s resurgence, and newly appointed CEO Alex Chriss appears well-suited for the task. With a proven track record at Intuit, Chriss has demonstrated his ability to foster innovation and deliver results. His focus on empowering small businesses aligns perfectly with PayPal’s strengths and provides a roadmap for future growth.

But the journey back to a P/E of 43 will require more than just strategic initiatives and innovation. PayPal needs to rebuild investor confidence. The company must consistently deliver strong earnings, improve operational efficiencies, and effectively communicate its vision to the market. Transparent updates on key growth areas—such as PYUSD adoption, advertising revenue, and merchant partnerships—will be crucial in shaping the market’s perception of PayPal’s potential.

A return to PayPal’s historical valuation isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the story the company tells and the trust it rebuilds with investors. If PayPal can execute on its strategy, the potential reward is not just a higher stock price but a reaffirmation of its position as a leader in the fintech space. For those willing to look beyond the current market sentiment, PayPal’s path to $246 offers a compelling narrative of transformation, growth, and untapped opportunity.

TL;DR: PayPal is undervalued at a P/E of 20 compared to its historical average of 43. To return to its peak valuation, it must capitalize on its stablecoin (PYUSD), grow its new advertising business, and leverage innovative products like Fastlane Checkout. Under CEO Alex Chriss, with strategic execution and strong earnings, PayPal could see a stock price of $246 by 2025, reaffirming its leadership in fintech.

Microsoft faces wide-ranging U.S. antitrust probe,"The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air.  
  
The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month.  
  
The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday.

Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday.  
  
The FTC fielded complaints about Microsoft last year as it examined the cloud computing market.

NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies including Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft’s licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook.

“Given that Microsoft is the world’s largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,” the group said.  
The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.  
  
Until now, Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators’ recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies.  
  
Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple, and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies.  
  
Alphabet’s Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines.  
  
Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google’s trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence.  
  
It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse.  
  
Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past.  
  
In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.

I don't understand MicroStrategy,"It has 386,700 biiitttcoin which is approx. $36 billion. But it's market cap is $77 billion? Why?

Say biiitttcoin price continues to rise. But will it rise faster than the debt interest rate? How will it cover expenses + pay the debt interest + pay the debt?

Why I think UBER is a BUY,"**Personal trading context:**

I do not look at balance sheets ever. I invest in companies that are undervalued due to bad publicity and not bad product. This year when CrowdStrike dipped from $390 to $217 I immediately took a position because I knew it was because of panic and not because the company's products are losing inherent value. I did the same for Meta during the whole VR panic and Tesla earlier this year. All of which dipped and are now up by more than 100%. Stock prices are determined by emotional sentiment so analyzing balance sheets are a waste of time to me.

**About Uber:**

I don't know anything about Uber's debts or profits, but I do know they are deviously good at getting around regulations and have completely pitted customers and drivers against each other. Recently I saw a post saying how Uber is sorry that they will now only allow drivers hired by agencies to drive instead of individual contractors in some European region. Do you think Uber is *really* sorry? This sounds like the government is getting involved and constricting Uber but I'm going to tell you why these things don't even matter.

Recently in my area the government passed regulations making Uber pay a minimum of $20.88/hr. You'd assume this will cut into Uber's profits but they got around it and drivers are not actually getting any of that money. What's crazy is that they're now pocketing more money from customers due to this change. I went into detail in another post which is important for you to read to help fully comprehend my view: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new\_uber\_2088\_minimum\_pay\_is\_not\_what\_you\_think/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UberEATS/comments/1gzpvrd/new_uber_2088_minimum_pay_is_not_what_you_think/)

After going through that link you *should* understand that on the surface it seems like drivers will benefit from a minimum pay but they're actually earning less and customers are paying more. This is where I'm dumbfounded because even though I pointed out that Uber is deceiving it's customers and charging them a bogus ""service fee"", instead of getting mad at Uber they're getting mad at me for insinuating that drivers should get paid more. I thought I was doing a good thing by informing people how the new ""service fee"" they're paying to cover the driver minimums are actually getting pocketed by Uber, but nobody seems to care and instead enjoys the fact that drivers are not getting paid more money. I've been getting posts in my feed from r/tipping recently and they're pretty much all complaints against restaurants, drivers, and overall tipping culture. I also constantly get posts from drivers complaining about customers on r/UberEatsDrivers. Customers don't want to tip and are ignorant about how the job works. They hate drivers. Drivers make less money and hate customers as a result. Both sides have been completely brain washed and pitted against each other when the real enemy is actually Uber themselves. This is amazing for investors.

I love how Uber is able to take advantage of people and cleverly get around regulations that are meant to make them less competitive to make even more money. If you really want to make conspiracies you can even go as far as saying Uber themselves wants these new regulations to pass because they know it benefits them. Customers are the product and the drivers are just disposable pawns until they can get robo taxis to drive for them. If you like A.I. this makes Uber a great alternative to buying straight NVDA or TSLA. They don't give a shit about you or me. Only revenue, but they're damn good at hiding that from their customers and drivers. I fucking love it. If you're going to spend money on Uber, spend it on shares.

**Again, I don't read balance sheets ever. Please do inform me on why it matters and why Uber is NOT A GOOD BUY.**",0,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h2kshj/why_i_think_uber_is_a_buy/
"PCE rises to 2.3% annually, ""meeting expectations""","I'm surprised the market has been taking this in stride. Although this data is ""meeting expectations"", it does paint a picture of sticky inflation and with the incoming tariffs why isn't the market more negative? Are people just out of office already?

via [MSNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/27/pce-inflation-october-2024.html):

* Core inflation showed even stronger readings, with an increase at 0.3% on a monthly basis and an annual reading of 2.8%, also as forecast.
* Spending rose 0.4% on the month, as forecast, while personal income jumped 0.6%, well above the 0.3% estimate.

Could Coinbase enter the S&P 500 in the Dec Rebalance? What do you think!,"[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) Global Inc. (COIN) has demonstrated significant growth, meeting several key benchmarks considered by the S&P 500 Index Committee. However, its performance is closely tied to the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin. This correlation is evident, as Coinbase's stock price often mirrors Bitcoin's fluctuations. For instance, during bullish Bitcoin trends, Coinbase experiences increased trading volumes and revenues, leading to higher stock valuations. Out off all the likely companies [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is in my top 3 for inclusion this Rebalance.  
  
The forthcoming S&P 500 rebalance will indeed be indicative of the Index Committee's perspective on integrating companies like Coinbase, which are deeply embedded in the cryptocurrency sector. Inclusion of such a company would signal a significant shift towards embracing the evolving financial landscape and acknowledging the growing prominence of digital assets. Conversely, opting not to include Coinbase might suggest a more cautious approach, reflecting concerns about the inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties associated with the crypto market. Therefore, the committee's decision will not only impact Coinbase but also serve as a broader statement on the acceptance of digital asset platforms within traditional financial indices.

[TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/BTCUSDT/fiO01sTb-Dynamic-Relationship-Between-Bitcoin-and-Coinbase/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

The S&P 500 Index Committee employs specific criteria for inclusion, such as market capitalisation, liquidity, domicile, public float, and financial viability. While Coinbase may satisfy these quantitative measures, the committee also exercises qualitative judgment, considering factors like market stability and the company's role within its industry.

[Corporate Finance Institute](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/equities/sp-500-index/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Given Coinbase's substantial exposure to the volatile cryptocurrency market, the committee might deliberate on the potential risks associated with such volatility. The decision to include a company so intertwined with the crypto sector would reflect the committee's stance on the evolving financial landscape and its readiness to integrate digital asset platforms into traditional indices.

In summary, while Coinbase appears to meet the fundamental requirements for S&P 500 inclusion, its strong correlation with Bitcoin introduces considerations that the committee will likely scrutinise, balancing traditional financial principles with the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market.",0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1z88c/could_coinbase_enter_the_sp_500_in_the_dec/

EC Stock - Value opportunity,"Hey all,

I think I'm gonna open a position on EC, it's got a P/E ratio of 4.58, it's at a close-to historic low, and I think the fundamentals are there. It's got good cash albeit with some debt, it's subsizdized by the columbian government and provides 3% of their total GDP. Gustav Petro is a leftist president but he has a right-leaning congress and likely won't impact the company any more than he already has, he's also pretty unpopular and will likely be voted out in 2026. I acknowledge it has worse margins than Petrobras per barrel, but it is still profitable with strong revenue. Curious if anyone else was thinking about making a similar move or had different perspectives on the stock.",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h1k1yf/ec_stock_value_opportunity/

Deep dive into Kering - From Timber to Gucci: A Legacy of Acquisitions,"**1.0 Introduction**

Let’s start with a fun fact. Kering, the company that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta, and Alexander McQueen, started as a **timber-trading company**.

Although it started back in 1962 and operated in a different industry, its DNA and management style haven’t changed much.

As I’m writing this, its share price is **down over 70%** from its peak back in August 2021 that was elevated due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

  
**2.0 The journey from timber to luxury**

***2.1 The timber period (1962 - 1988)***

The company was founded in France by François Pinault back in 1962 with a 100,000 francs loan from the bank. The business grew rapidly by **acquiring** many failing local timber traders in France, especially in the 1980s. By 1988, it owned 180 companies and 33 factories.

***2.2 The switch from timber to retail to luxury (1988 - 2013 - present)***

In 1988, it was listed on the Paris Stock Exchange and the first transformation from timber to retail started:

* It merged with CFAO (A French distribution conglomerate)
* Acquired Conforama (French furniture retailer)
* Acquired Printemps (Department stores)
* Acquired 54% of La Redoute (French mail-order shopping retailer)
* Acquired Finac (French bookstore, multimedia, and electronics retailer)

The transformation from retail to luxury started in 1999 when it acquired 42% of **Gucci Group,** 100% of **Boucheron,** and 100% of **Yves Saint Laurent.** Today, Gucci accounts for 47% of its revenue.

François-Henri Pinault, the son of the founder François Pinault, became general manager of the company in 2003, and CEO in 2005. Under his leadership, the acquisitions in the luxury space continued.

It is important to note the divestments of their previous acquisitions (Conforama, Le Printemps, CFAO, and Fnac).

Its portfolio is quite diversified and includes:

* High-end clothing
* Footwear
* Handbags and leather goods
* Sunglasses and eyewear
* Scarves & other fashion accessories
* Jewelry
* Fragrances (due to the Creed acquisition)
* Cosmetics (in early stage)
* Watches

It is also geographically diversified:

* **APAC (excl. Japan)**: 32% of revenue
* **Western Europe**: 28% of revenue
* **North America**: 23% of revenue
* **Japan**: 8% of revenue
* **Rest of the World**: 9% of revenue

**3.0 Historical financial performance**

Its revenue increased from €15.9 billion in 2019, to €20.4 billion in 2022, and has contracted back to €18.4 billion as the demand for personal luxury goods started to decrease after the pandemic. 

Kering’s gross margin is stable at \~75%, meaning the direct costs are well controlled.

However, its operating margin is down below 20% (vs. 29% back in 2019). The explanation is simple.

**Reducing operating expenses is an incredibly tough job.**

When there’s less traffic (and subsequently less sales) in the physical stores, the operating expenses remain the same. The company still needs to pay the lease payment, its employees, the utility bills, etc. In fact, these expenses grow over time as there’s the impact of inflation.

Scaling down, by closing locations is also not a free option. Not only does it bring penalties for ending a lease contract earlier, but it also leads to losing all the revenue and profitability from that location.

The company is generating substantial cash flows, but I’ll argue the capital allocation is poor.

||all numbers in €m|
|:-|:-|
|Cash (January 2019)|€1.837|
|Operating cash flow|€21.541|
|Capex|(€7.772)|
|Acquisitions|(€6.559)|
|Debt|€4.887|
|Share buyback|(€2.034)|
|Dividends|(€8.229)|
|Other|€25|
|Cash (June 2024)|€3.696|

Between 2019 and H1-2024, the company generated **over €21.5 billion** in operating cash flow, or **a bit less than €14 billion after capex.**

Close to 60% of it was returned back to the shareholders via dividends, and an additional 15% through share buybacks. What’s left of the free cash flow, together with additional debt, was used for acquisitions.

Why do I think the capital allocation is poor? Two main reasons:

1. Almost 80% of the share buybacks were used in 2021 and 2022, the years when the share price was the highest (and temporarily elevated). A good capital allocator can recognize when the price is too high to buy back shares.
2. Its net debt position more than doubled, from **€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024. This is equal to \~60% of its market cap. The interest rate on their debt ranges from 0.75% to 5% and if the refinancing is done at a higher rate, it could significantly reduce its profit margins.



**4.0 What can be expected?**

Based on the latest investor presentation, there are three capital allocation priorities:

* Organic growth;
* Shareholder return; and
* Fuel high-potential adjacent businesses.

All of it, while having a **healthy financial situation and FCF generation.**

This is a good attempt by the management to summarize what to expect from the company. I find this slide a bit odd for three reasons:

1. On one side they want to return capital to the shareholders, which would position them as a company **with a goal to preserve capital and provide reliable dividends**. On the other side, its history is full of **acquisitions, which is the opposite of preserving capital.**
2. The center of the slide points to a healthy financial situation and FCF generation, while its net debt more than doubled in the last 5 years (**€7.1 billion** in 2019 to **€15.4 billion** as of June 30th, 2024).
3. Innovation is not a focus at all. Roughly 2 months ago, EssilorLuxottica and Meta announced a partnership in the smart eyewear category. I see a lot of potential in this area that isn’t utilized (yet).

**Growing through acquisitions and distributing dividends seems to be the DNA of the company and likely what one should expect going forward.**

  
**5.0 Dividends**

The dividend per share has been steadily increasing from €4 back in 2015, to €14 in 2024. The current dividend yield is \~6%.

If the management focuses on reducing the debt and dividends (instead of borrowing to acquire more companies), Kering could become an incredibly appealing dividend investment option.

  
**6.0 High employee turnover**

At the end of 2023, the company had 48,964 employees. During the year, there were **13,403** new hires, and **11,275** employees departed. At first glance, this is no doubt a high turnover.

This sounds bad at first, but it is really difficult to decipher.

In theory, any company that has seasonal employment patterns will hire more employees (temporarily) during peak seasons. Therefore the increase, and subsequently decrease, of employees is normal. This is even more so in industries where the work is repetitive (such as sales and manufacturing).

In addition, 59% of the employees are Gen Y (1981-1995), a generation that is known for seeking career growth, which could lead to more job-hopping than average.

Given the reviews on Indeed, Glassdoor, and Comparably, there is no indication that this is currently a serious issue.

  
**7.0 The concerns**

**7.1 Balenciaga Advertising Scandal (2022)**

Back in 2022, Balenciaga faced significant backlash over their advertising campaign. One of them featured children holding teddy bears dressed in bondage-inspired outfits. This was rightfully criticized and labeled as inappropriate.

This brings into question the ethics behind those who are in charge of product development and marketing.

In addition, given how concentrated their portfolio is in the top 3 brands (Gucci - 46%, YSL - 17%, Bottega Veneta - 9%), scandals of this kind could have a significant impact.

**7.2 Preliminary investigation by the European Commission (2023)**

In April 2023, the European Commission initiated a preliminary investigation into potential antitrust violations within the fashion sector. One of the inspections took place at the Italian premises of Gucci.

An investigation of this kind does not imply guilt, but if a company is found in breach of EU antitrust rules, there could lead to a fine of a few billion euros.

The investigation is still ongoing, and no conclusions have been reached.

  
**8.0 Valuation** 

This is a mature market that will be around for a very long time. Therefore, here are my assumptions when it comes to valuing Kering:

* **Revenue** \- The industry is cyclical in nature, so there will be good and bad times. Based on the past, I do not feel confident that Kering can take market share, so I expect its growth to normalize at \~3% per year, which is in line with the inflation rate.
* **Operating margin** \- The luxury market is getting more crowded, and as argued earlier, reducing operating expenses is not an easy task. Once the demand is somewhat stable, I expect the operating margin to increase to 21%.

Based on those assumptions (and a discount rate of \~9%), the fair value of the company is **€27 billion (€220/share)** which is very close to the current price of **€224/share**.

This offers an IRR of \~9%, which is slightly below the historical return of the S&P500.

  
**8.1 The Bull Case**

Those who are betting on Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue growth and margin expansion through some of the following:

* Revitalization of Balenciaga & rebuilding its reputation after the controversies;
* Sustained growth in Gucci, and expansion of secondary brands like Bottega Veneta & Saint Laurent;
* The success of its newly launched beauty division, capturing market share from rivals like LVMH and Estee Lauder;
* Positive macro tailwinds;

* Utilizing pricing power;
* Integration of recent acquisitions;
* Reducing operating costs;

**If the management can pull this off, then the value per share could be 2x from today’s share price.**



**8.2 The Bear Case**

Those who are betting against Kering, are ultimately betting that there will be revenue decline and margin compression through some of the following:

* Brand mismanagement & more scandals;
* Inability to revitalize Balenciaga;
* Inability to innovate around its primary brands;
* Failure to integrate its acquisitions & further poor M&A acquisitions;
* Negative macro tailwinds;
* Inability to innovate around E-Commerce;
* Supply chain issues;
* Competitive pressure;
* Increase in corporate tax by the French authorities

**In this scenario, the fair value per share could be below €100/share.**

Looking for advice: combining technical analysis with news-based and high-volatility trading,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been trading more actively lately, focusing on high-volatility stocks and news-based opportunities. This year has been very successful for me. I’ve managed to achieve returns that were even above the S&P 500, so I’m really happy with my progress.

That said, I’m always looking to improve, and I’m wondering if integrating technical analysis into my approach could help me refine my strategy further. I usually hold my positions for a few days to a few weeks. I have a few questions:
	
1.	Which technical indicators would you recommend for someone trading on a short to medium term basis and reacting to news-driven moves?
	
2.	Are there specific timeframes or chart setups that work better for trades lasting days or weeks? 
	
3.	Are there any books, courses, or resources you’d recommend for learning technical analysis, especially for high-volatility setups?
	
4.	How do you handle risk management when trading in such volatile environments?

5.   How can I identify which stocks are likely to have the highest trading volume or volatility during the day ?

I know there’s no one size fits all solution, but I believe combining fundamental insights with technical analysis could help me make better informed decisions.


Thanks in advance to anyone who shares their experience or advice!

$Dell Earnings ,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure. With the growing focus on AI and enterprise tech, it feels like Dell could see steady, long-term growth and break out to that $150 range by Q2 2024. 

Thoughts? Should I continue to hold? Or sell during the holiday rally? My portfolio time horizon is short giving I plan to liquidate July 2024 to buy a house. ",55,45,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h0q55v/dell_earnings/

Rivian Receives Conditional Commitment for up to $6.6 Billion Loan from the U.S. Department of Energy,"RVINE, Calif., November 26, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American all-electric automaker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced it has received conditional commitment from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program for a loan of up to $6.6 billion (including $6 billion of principal and approximately $600 million of capitalized interest) to accelerate its growth and leadership of electric vehicle design, development and manufacturing in the United States.

If finalized, the loan would support the construction of Rivian’s next facility in Stanton Springs North, near the city of Social Circle, Georgia, substantially expanding the company’s domestic production capacity to support demand from the United States and international markets. This loan from DOE would provide significant funding for production of the company’s midsize platform, which underpins the R2, a midsize SUV, and the R3/R3X, a midsize crossover. Designed, engineered, and built in America to deliver an incredible combination of capability, function, performance, and pricing, Rivian believes its R2 and R3 vehicle lines will be critical drivers in the company’s long-term growth and profitability.

The DOE loan would provide an important boost to the U.S. automotive industrial base, enabling significant job creation and investment that is important for the United States to maintain its leadership as electric vehicles become a strategically important industry.

Rivian intends to build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity–supporting the sale of American EVs in international markets. Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. Rivian is expected to create approximately 7,500 operations jobs through 2030 at the company’s future manufacturing facility in Georgia. This is in addition to 2,000 expected full-time construction jobs that will utilize the region’s significant talent and workforce to further strengthen the domestic EV ecosystem. These jobs complement the thousands Rivian has already created and plans to maintain at its current plant in Normal, Illinois, which have bolstered the local and regional economy.

""This loan will help create thousands of new American jobs and further strengthen U.S. leadership in EV manufacturing and technology,"" said Rivian Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability. A robust ecosystem of U.S. companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the U.S. to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

Rivian plans to design and build a fully modern manufacturing facility at the Stanton Springs Site, less than one hour’s drive from downtown Atlanta, employing modern construction techniques and advanced environmental management while preserving natural spaces and investing actively in the surrounding communities.

Over the history of the loan program, DOE has helped energize American EV manufacturing with billions in financing for this strategically important industry, including loans to General Motors and Tesla.

While this conditional commitment indicates DOE’s intent to finance the project, DOE and the company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the Department of Energy enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. If finalized, the loan would be secured by all assets of the project and fixed assets and guarantees of the parent company, Rivian Automotive, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries.

Opinions on ZETA?,"
I have watched this stock for some time and it is super interesting.

• Culper research shorts ZETA and publishes findings on some misconducts from ZETA.

• Shares drop big time

• ZETA responds to all claims from culper and
""proves"" them as lies. One of examples is that Culper mentiones EY as ZETA's auditor but EY was never ZETA's auditor. It was always Deloitte...

• ZETA insiders buy large amount of shares as another sign to support the company and that Culper research is lying and playing dirty.

• Shares bounce back a bit.

• Former Louisiana attorney general leads class action suit against ZETA (another dirty move to stop a bounce back or honestly concerned ex politician?).

• Shares drop this week again.

Isn't it crazy how few people can destroy a company for personal interest using deception and dirty tricks? Or is the company the one that is corrupt?

In my opinion Culper clearly lied on many things as a strategy for their short positions, history showed that companies that were shorted by Culper did just fine in the future. Is this case the same?

What is your opinion on this? Is it good entry point, is it too risky to enter.

Btw fundamentals of this company are good.
Healthy growth, nice debt ratio and management, strong institutional ownership etc.

Trump's transition team is considering eliminating the federal tax credit of $7,500 for EV purchases, Reuters reported this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser, sharply criticized the idea of barring the automaker from EV subsidies writing on X in response ""Even though Tesla is the only company who manufactures their EVs in California! This is insane.""

Musk has said he supports ending subsidies for EVs, oil and gas.

Newsom said on Monday that if Trump eliminates a federal EV tax credit, he will propose creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program that ended in 2023 and spent $1.49 billion to subsidize more than 594,000 vehicles.

""The governor’s proposal for ZEV rebates, and any potential market cap, is subject to negotiation with the legislature. Any potential market cap would be intended to foster market competition, innovation and to support new market entrants,"" the office said.

California provided up to $7,500 for the purchase or lease of a new plug-in hybrid, battery or fuel cell EV and could potentially be paid for by the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund which is funded by polluters under the state's cap-and-trade program.

Musk and Newsom have clashed over state policies such as shutting Tesla's Fremont factory during the pandemic and California's approval of a bill on transgender kids.

In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from California to Texas, and Musk said this year that his other companies such as SpaceX and social media platform X will follow suit.

California has crossed the 2 million mark for sales of zero-emission vehicles, doubling total sales since 2022.

Last month, a California official said he expects the Environmental Protection Agency to approve the state's plan to halt the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035, a proposal that major automakers have met with skepticism.
California's rules, which have been adopted by a dozen other states, require 80% of all new vehicles sold in the state be electric by 2035 and no more than 20% plug-in hybrid electric.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help **measure the trajectory of a security.**  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Zenas Biopharma (ZBIO),"High risk high reward

The drug is also in phase 2 trials for other autoimmune diseases. They are expected to complete their phase 3 trials in 2026. The current data from the phase 2 trials seems promising. Current drugs on the market for these diseases bring in around 10B a year in revenue. The companies current market cap is 460M and the company as a book value circa 350M.

Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.



||||
|:-|:-|:-|
|""Chrome"" as a stand-alone listed company like Opera browser.|Possibly the worst move. Average user unlikely to install a browser-only app, than stick with factory default browser on the device. ||
|Chrome+Gemini as a new company, to command an ""AI"" valuation.|Not likely to attract advertisers, until this new 'app' gets wild Chat-GPT like popularity. ||
|Android+Chrome as a new company, provides operating system for device manufacturers|Won't make sense, because Samsung already has their prop. version of Android. And to gain search traffic, Google again needs to partner with this new company, which is prohibited.||
|A company with ""personal suite"" of applications, Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Chrome bundled together|Chrome then gets 100's million users from Day-1. Still, above legal prohibition remains. ||
|Settlement|Make it all go away!||

Any other speculations? With so much uncertainty, the stock will remain under pressure with downward bias, until there's clarity on the case.

MDA Space blowing up by year’s end (contract incoming),"All this hype with RKLB, LUNR, and RDW and no-one is mentioning MDA (mktcap - 3.2b CAD). Yeah I know it mainly trades on Toronto but just get a broker that supports Toronto, eg IBKR. They’re planning to list on US soon but by then it will probably already have taken off...

Their earnings report was stellar: growth of 38% yoy, it is actually **PROFITABLE** \- none of the other space companies are profitable - profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $55.5 million, up 30% YoY, and adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, net income up 60% yoy, and net debt adjusted EBITDA ratio of just 0.8x (so zero risk of dilution). However, post earnings the stock was mostly flat. Why? Their reported backlog was unchanged from previous quarter report (backlog is 4.6B btw).

But if any of you folks had bothered to tune in to the call, you would have heard the CEO say that it is a fact that by year end they will be **definitely be signing a new contract worth 750M** – of these, only 300M is recorded in backlog – a**n additional $450M is going to be added** upon finalization and t**his will happen by year’s end.** They in fact stated during the Q&A that they are confident they will be finishing 2024 with $5B backlog. They also said MDA’s satellite systems division alone has a $**15B+ pipeline** of potential projects, thanks to its Aurora-class satellites tailored for low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations.

Still not convinced? Consider:

\> MDA is building a new 185,000 sq. ft. facility in Quebec, **capable of producing two satellites per day** starting in late 2025.

\>Planet labs is currently generating about 200million in revenue per year. MDA’s geointelligence segment is also generating about 200million in revenue per year. However, MDA’s geo segment represents **only about 20%** of MDA’s total revenue. PL’s marketcap is currently almost **1B**. MDA is 3.1 CAD = **2.2B USD**. Oh, and PL is currently operating at a loss (though that might change next report) but MDA is running a profit. Based on this fact alone, MDA’s mkt cap should be at least double than what it is.

Ganja Bear Case (and one possible exception),"I think cannabis is an abysmally bad investment opportunity (with one exception) and almost no one knows why, because the precise nature of how THC as a drug operates isn't well understood by people who aren't both habitual consumers \*and\* up-to-date with knowledge on that sector this past decade or so.

It's the following issue: Let's say it's 2010 when cannabis is still illegal everywhere and I want to get high, I light up a single (1) joint with my friend, we smoke for 20 minutes, and then we're giggling. We go to buy some twice a month or so. A few years later it's been legalized and a ton of money floods into the space. Growers are all trying to compete with each other to take advantage of the laws changing, everyone wants to make stronger weed that gets you high more quickly than the other kinds, to draw customers to them, get market share and so on. ""Buy my iridescent purple galactic stardust reefer that gets you as high in one puff as 10x that amount of the neighboring place's stuff.""

This is a race to the bottom. Soon everyone is selling incredibly strong stuff, but you need \*far less\* of it to get the same high. Habitual users spend less than 10% of what they used to on weed now, everything is absurdly strong and cheap because of this competition. In addition you now have hash oil, edibles, dab pens, tinctures, you name it. Not just regular flower.

I never smoked much anyway, but in the rare case I want a mini-vacation now, I can take a vial of Tincture and put \*one drop\* under my tongue. Within two hours the world is spinning. It's so strong I never use it as anything other than a sleeping aid about once a month. A single bottle of this costs about $65, and it comfortably lasts me an entire year. This is a disaster for the industry because I almost never need to give them business. It's so strong that I rarely need to make a purchase at all. And no need for all the paraphernalia with it either. No vapes, pipes, lighters etc. The bottle comes with an eyedropper. Even if I use it often and develop a high tolerance, I still rarely need to go out for more. My friend and I have no reason to go smoke or spend much money on the supplies for it when for 1/100th the price we can get the same high now, assuming one of us has a tincture (or dab vape pen, or edible, or a newly exotic and potent strain) at home.

Compare this with alcohol, where you can't make, say, vodka much stronger than it is. It's impossible for me to come up with a 10x stronger vodka to put my competitors out of business because it's physically impossible for alcohol to exist at room temperature at concentrations higher than \~97% (I think), and vodka is already around 45% and can't reasonably go much higher (taste etc). Also there is a social nature to it that weed lacks, beer works more as a refreshment beverage like coke etc.

Or cigarettes, where even if you have a huge nicotine tolerance from constant Zyn use, the nature of the substance requires you to take it every couple hours to keep from getting jittery. You can't just get a year's supply of nicotine in a bottle because (first of all it'd be fatal with a slight dosage error) you need to have it in measured amounts you can take every 2-4 hours regardless of how much you're used to consuming, assuming you're dependent on it to begin with of course. And so it is a consistent business for sellers. This is most true of cigarettes, but also applies to vapes and pouches, which have similarly excellent profit margins. All of these a nicotine addict must consume regularly. Regulations also limit how much nicotine you can put in each product.

It is a subscription model, in short, while weed is equivalent to motor oil in terms of how often someone (a very heavy user to boot) has to go out and buy some, and how much they spend. Alcohol has some issues as well of lesser magnitude that I can go into elsewhere, but can lean on its usefulness in social situations whereas weed cannot.

The only exception to this? Turning Point Brands (TPB) stock, because they don't sell weed. They sell rolling papers and other paraphernalia for it. Which is indeed still a growing business if it gets legalized in more places and benefits from the greater proliferation of the stuff. Actual weed sellers do not, because the increased proliferation is offset by people needing to buy less of it for the same results due to increased THC concentration in the products. You can't sell 1/10th as much paper to people for the same effect, or at least it's less affected by this issue. The company also is wisely getting into nicotine pouches although this is very ambitious of them to compete with the tobacco majors directly on something. Not sure how that'll work out. Keep in mind this is a small cap company, less than $1 billion in market cap, reflecting how little profit there is to be made even on the periphery of this sector. But it's one small and thriving business I can find that has benefited from all this quite nicely. Not sure how much more it can grow, it's probably overvalued now, but in the past year or so it's risen strongly.

Otherwise? Cronos and other weed stocks? Bunk. For the birds. There might be an exception for medical marijuana (CBD) companies but that's pure conjecture as far as I know. You can make condensed CBD products just the same.",0,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gzfcoy/ganja_bear_case_and_one_possible_exception/
Evaluation of Companies with Down Revenue,"I find this an interesting topic and am interested how others feel if a company would be considered potentially bullish with the following fundamentals.

- Cash flow per share growth (year over year)
- *Net profit margin growth (year over year)
- Lower long-term debt (year over year)

BUT ALSO HAS…

- Lower revenue (year over year)
- Lower net income (year over year)
- Lower earnings per share (year over year)

In my opinion when revenue (or net income) is declining, and not flat or increasing, it is a concern that the company could be on the brink of a big downturn. Especially in a continued pattern of these results.

However, I often see companies with these symptoms, (sometimes in different combinations but at least two of these are lower year over year), however the chart is very bullish at times…

Thoughts? (Thanks in advance for your opinion)

Delaware Funds by Macquarie,"Does anyone have any insight into Delaware Funds managed by Macquarie? 

Unfortunately, I was persuaded to purchase into one of the small / mid cap mutual funds in December 2020. Obviously the market was on a bit of a run there, but everything about the fund (historical build up, Morningstar ratings, length of existence of the fund, recommendations by publications, YoY performance,  etc) led me to believe it was a reasonable, if somewhat more aggressive, investment.  

It was all well and good for about a year, as the market rebounded from Covid and this particular fund hummed along with the rest of the economy.   Articles like [this in the mainstream press](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-stock-picks-for-the-post-pandemic-nesting-economy-from-a-five-star-money-manager-11636995166?mod=bnbh_mwarticle) lent further credence that the fund was solid and the fund managers respected by financial journalism. 

And then it did a capital gains distribution (historically very normal for this fund) in December 2021 and then the share price immediately started its plummet.  Like, overnight, lost $15/share.  Similarly, it went seemingly overnight from a Morningstar 5 rating to a 2 rating.  It continued to fall from there. 

  
I guess I am one of those silly buy and hold people.  I always assume that short term losses will eventually be made up in the long term.  Since then....no. 

  
Earlier this year, Delaware merged a couple of their funds, so DFDIX became IYMIX.   As far as I can tell, the holdings in IYMIX are not radically different than what DFDIX held.   In a market that has been turbo charged for the past year, the growths of this fund have been glacial.   I realize that the holdings are small / mid cap and those are ostensibly still being knocked around by high interest rates, but the three years since that initial freefall following the capital gains distribution has not really begun to make up the ground that the fund dramatically lost. 

I've literally never been in a mutual fund that actively lost money for me.  Plenty have not grown in dramatic ways, but actually halving of value?  That's never happened before. 

Does anyone have any insight into this investment company or explanation why a small / midcap fund would depreciate to such a dramatic extent and fail to recover over a period of years when stock market growth is explosive? 

  
I'm a little heartsick at the thought of just cutting losses and investing in Vanguard or something but it's been really stressful.  

Thanks in advance.  (And yes, I realize I should have been using trailing stops, but didn't, so no lectures there, please.)",9,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gy4ckp/delaware_funds_by_macquarie/

What I learnt from MSTR frenzy,"I have been a long term investor in MSTR, in fact buying  my position Pre-split.  
My thesis was very much connected to an alternative investment vehicle into Bitcoin.  Even though I have BTC as a holding in my crypto, I was more after exposure in an equity portfolio.

To cut a long story short, I bought it when it was no mainstream and no ETF's were existing.

I must admit, I sat on a loss for about one year in MSTR.  Buying at $48.10 (split adjusted), and for the longest time sitting at the $25-$30 range, BTC was consolidating and I was fine with that.

If people understand what MSTR are doing, this playbook with bonds and hedging BTC was already in play for a long time, I was lucky enough to understand this quite early and and bought it quite early.  The difference being now that BTC is on a breakout and other companies are now looking into this method as well, the eyes on MSTR has multiplied exponentially .

Fast forward one year, and and the FOMO crowd arrived, and with that volatility.

Here is what I learnt when the FOMO arrived:

1. The stock is no longer trading on anything but emotion and speculation.
2. Valuations do not matter anymore.  The premium on BTC was as low as 1.5 less than one year go, reaching a peak earlier this week at 3.5
3. The stock goes up like crazy, and comes down like crazy, and when this happens, it's time to exit as there is nothing that is in your control.
4. There is so much manipulation (e.g. the citron report, Social media, Mainstream coverage), on what... a damn tweet!  it is not really easy to understand how this will move, so at this point it is just gambling.

I held my position up to the $543 level, and eventually my stop losses triggered yesterday around the $500 level.  So after 1.5 years, I am out of the MSTR trade.

The lesson I learnt is when the crowds arrive, turn round and walk away.

I still believe in the MSTR playbook, but will only come back when I am at the front of the queue buying at a negotiated price not when I am in a bidding war with gamblers.",518,174,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx4xb6/what_i_learnt_from_mstr_frenzy/
Thoughts and dilemma on Rocket Lab? ,"I went into Rocket Lab back in July with the intention of making it my primary long-term growth stock and since then have managed to acquire 440 shares at average price of around $9.  

My intention was/is to keep buying and hold the stock for many many years, because I truly believe in the company potential and the overall space industry and I believe that it will be a key growth sector for the next decade and beyond regardless of who is in power in the US. (I am not american btw)

Just before the election I was in profit in the low thousands, which was nice but since the election I am now sitting at a profit of 147%, which is my best position in my investing ""career"" so far. 

Like I said, I believe the company will do well regardless of who is in power. However, given the fast rise since the election I am expecting correction happening soon. 

And my dilemma is: should exit now and take the profits and then go back in after the correction? Or should I just hold until the potential correction and start buying more then? 

What would you do in my situation?",148,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx7ofy/thoughts_and_dilemma_on_rocket_lab/
Are we putting too much faith in generative AI? Could this hurt AI investments more broadly?,"Obviously a lot of money is being made off of AI-related stocks. I'm not one of those lucky investors. Part of the reason is that I fear we're not in a general AI bubble, as many have discussed, but rather a *generative AI* bubble. I'd appreciate hearing how others feel about this.

Right now, by far the bulk of investment is focused on generative AI (especially LLMs), with NVDA at or very near the center of it all, thanks to its GPUs. Meanwhile, alternative AI approaches (e.g., neuromorphic computing, symbolic AI, reinforcement learning, and hybrid models) have been getting far less attention.

The problem? As impressive as it may seem, generative AI has some significant (and inherent) drawbacks:

* Factually unreliable outputs (it can’t reliably distinguish fact from fiction)
* Probabilistic reasoning (no true causal understanding)
* High computational costs (questionable sustainability)
* Limited real-world problem-solving abilities

At some point, the reality of generative AI's limitations will become apparent enough to investors that we could see an AI market correction or even collapse. This would not only hurt AI stocks like NVDA, but it could also starve funding for alternative AI approaches that have long-term potential yet have been largely overlooked.

What do you think? How is this influencing your investment decisions?",54,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxezqq/are_we_putting_too_much_faith_in_generative_ai/
C3AI begins to turn the tide,"C3.ai shares jumped 25% in a single day on the announcement of a deeper partnership with Microsoft. The new agreement clarifies Microsoft Azure as C3.ai's preferred cloud services platform and C3.ai's AI applications as Azure's preferred enterprise solutions. Although the two have been working together since 2018, this announcement pushes the market's focus on its AI potential higher.

Underestimated potential: c3.ai's revenue grew 21% in the quarter and is expected to grow 24% going forward. Current market capitalization is \~$4 billion and trades at a multiple of 11x its FY2025 revenue target.

Pilots: The company has 224 pilots, 85% of which are active, representing a 117% year-over-year increase in the number of pilots. 70% of pilots are expected to be converted into formal contracts.

Future Potential: Revenues are expected to pick up to 30% from current growth rates through pilots to formal deals. 2026 FY projected revenue target is $462 million, with a share price potential of up to $36 if it reaches an 8x EV/revenue valuation.

While the partnership has boosted market enthusiasm, I would wait for market sentiment to pull back before getting in. In addition, the conversion of pilots to full-fledged programs is key to future growth.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Intuit shares drop as quarterly forecast misses estimates due to delayed revenue,"Intuit shares fell 6% in extended trading Thursday after the finance software maker issued a revenue forecast for the current quarter that trailed analysts’ estimates due to some sales being delayed.

Here’s how the company performed in comparison with LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.50 adjusted vs. $2.35 expected

Revenue: $3.28 billion vs. $3.14 billion

Revenue increased 10% year over year in the quarter, which ended Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income fell to $197 million, or 70 cents per share, from $241 million, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

While results for the fiscal first quarter topped estimates, second-quarter guidance was light. Intuit said it anticipates a single-digit decline in revenue from the consumer segment because of promotional changes for the TurboTax desktop software in retail environments. While that will affect revenue timing, it won’t have any impact on the full 2025 fiscal year.

Intuit called for second-quarter earnings of $2.55 to $2.61 per share, with $3.81 billion to $3.85 billion in revenue. The consensus from LSEG was $3.20 per share and $3.87 billion in revenue.

For the full year, Intuit expects $19.16 to $19.36 in adjusted earnings per share on $18.16 billion to $18.35 billion in revenue. That implies revenue growth of between 12% and 13%. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for $19.33 in adjusted earnings per share and $18.26 billion in revenue.

Revenue from Intuit’s global business solutions group came in at $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The figure was up 9% and in line with estimates, according to StreetAccount. Formerly known as the small business and self-employed segment, the group includes Mailchimp, QuickBooks, small business financing and merchant payment processing.

“We are seeing good progress serving mid-market customers in MailChimp, but are seeing higher churn from smaller customers,” Sandeep Aujla, Intuit’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. “We are addressing this by making product enhancements and driving feature discoverability and adoption to improve first-time use and customer retention.”

Better outcomes are a few quarters away, Aujla said.

CreditKarma revenue came in at $524 million, above StreetAccount’s $430 million consensus.

At Thursday’s close, Intuit shares were up about 9% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 has gained almost 25% in the same period.

On Tuesday Intuit shares slipped 5% after The Washington Post said President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed “Department of Government Efficiency” had discussed developing a mobile app for federal income tax filing. But a mobile app for submitting returns from Intuit is “already available to all Americans,” CEO Sasan Goodarzi told CNBC’s Jon Fortt.

Goodarzi said on CNBC that he’s personally communicating with leaders of the incoming presidential administration.

On the earnings call, Goodarzi sounded optimistic about the economy.

“Our belief, which is not baked into our guidance, is that we will see an improved environment as we look ahead in 2025, particularly just with some of the things that I mentioned earlier around just interest rates, jobs, the regulatory environment,” he said. “These things have a real burden on businesses. And we believe that a better future is to come.”

Zeta global short attack,"Hi, I've been following ZETA global for quite while now. It has recently suffered a 50% blow to its SP due to not good enough earnings followed by a report from short seller ""Culper research"".
 I won't go into details of thier report, but after reading it I believe it is of very low quality (they even got the ZETAs auditor wrong lol).

After the decline of the price I was tempted to start building a position, especially since the SP was starting to recover. However, today in PM the shares are going back to around 20$. Another short seller (Lauren Balik) has published a report. To me it once again seems like a blatant attempt of trying to lower the price. It is overblown and full of speculation. She also published similiar articles on NVDA, APP, SNOW. But the market is dumping anyway.

Deep dive into Etsy - On a path to a dangerous spiral,"**1.0 Introduction**

Etsy started by brilliantly carving out a niche in handmade and vintage goods, but now it faces challenges that threaten its unique spot in e-commerce and I’ll argue it is going down the path to a dangerous spiral.

The idea to connect buyers with sellers of handmade/vintage goods is amazing, and there’s no doubt that there is demand for it.

Any marketplace has two important metrics:

* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website. Etsy decided to use **Gross Merchandise Sales** (“GMS“), which is just a different term.
* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMS.

Its GMS increased from \~$4 billion in 2018 (prior to the pandemic) to $13.5 billion in 2021. However, since then, Etsy has experienced a decline and the GMS in 2023 was $13.2 billion. The lack of growth is either a lack of demand or a lack of supply in the marketplace.

**2.0 The real problem**

The company discloses the number of active buyers and sellers, and together, they paint quite a picture.

The number of active sellers continued to grow. From 2021 to 2023, it increased from 7.5 million to 9 million.

The number of buyers has been flat.

Economics101 teaches us a simple lesson: ***If the demand is stable, and there is an increase in supply, the prices will decrease.***

Economics also teaches that ***lower prices would attract more buyers, increasing the demand.***

***So, where are the buyers?***

As Etsy doesn’t (and cannot) check the quality of all the products, more and more AI-generated product images combined with dropshipping flood the market. Here's a comment from a Reddit user that in my opinion does a great job summarizing the development:

""*Drop-shipping has absolutely ruined online marketplaces. I used to adore Etsy when it first started, but now its just absolute garbage. You have to reverse image search everything nowadays to make sure it's the real deal and actually handmade. This recently happened to me when I was trying to buy some pretty dice for my dnd group. Turned out it was a scam using a real artisan's pictures to sell their cheap shit. Thankfully, I was able to rectify the issue, but it was a hustle.*""

The U.S. sellers used to contribute over 75% of Etsy’s revenue a decade ago. Now, it’s down to \~50%.

I’ll argue that this might lead to a spiral that will harm Etsy in the long run, with the events being:

1. Increase in low-value products on Etsy.
2. The low-value products will be perceived as a better deal when compared to the high-value products as they are cheaper.
3. The sellers of high-value products will sell fewer products, and some of them will eventually leave Etsy.
4. The buyers will be disappointed by the low-value products and will not use Etsy as much (or at all).

**3.0 What is Etsy doing?**

Etsy is spending \~30% of its revenue on Marketing (vs. 20% a decade ago) and has even engaged in TV ads to raise awareness and bring new customers.

Over the last few years, the company has been spending $700-800m per year, only to keep the revenue flat. It is accepting the fact that buyers will be disappointed, and the strategy is to replace them with new ones.

**4.0 The take-rate**

The only other way for Etsy to grow its revenue is to increase its take-rate, and its share of the GMS.

The company splits its revenue into two groups:

* **Marketplace revenue** (\~73% of total) - These are **required** fees that cannot be avoided (Transaction fees, payment processing fees, listing fees).
* **Service revenue** (\~27% of total) - These are **optional**, such as on-site advertising, shipping labels, etc.

Its take-rate is incredibly high at \~21%, double from a decade ago. For comparison, eBay’s take rate is \~14%.

**5.0 Terrible management decisions**

As the company was reaching its peak, the management decided to make 3 large acquisitions:

* **Reverb** (Aug 15th, 2019) - A marketplace for new, used, and vintage music gear was acquired for **$270 million**.
* **Elo 7** (July 2nd, 2021) - Also known as the “Etsy of Brazil”, a Brazil-based marketplace for unique, handmade items was acquired for **$212 million**.
* **Depop** (July 12th, 2021) - a global fashion resale marketplace was acquired for \~**$1.5 billion**.

It is important to note that Depop had an annual revenue of **$70 million!** No, this is not a typo. Etsy paid over 20x its revenue to acquire Depop!

Well, not that long later, in Q3-2022, the company recorded impairment charges of **over $1 billion** for Depop and Elo7. No better way to destroy shareholders’ value quickly, than by overpaying for an acquisition.

A year later, in Q3-2023, Elo7 was sold at a loss.

**6.0 Historical financial performance**

Historically, this is still an impressive growth. Its revenue grew from <$200 million a decade ago, to $2.8 billion in the last twelve months and its gross margin remains stable at \~70%.

Its operating margin is lingering around 12% now, as both marketing & product development as % of revenue have been increasing. The increase in marketing expense (as % of revenue) has already been highlighted in a previous section. It is necessary to maintain the buyers’ base. So potential future improvements in the operating margin can only arise by decreasing the product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue).

**7.0 Valuation**

The two key variables when it comes to valuing a company are:

* **Revenue** \- Given that the number of active buyers hasn’t grown in the last few years, it is difficult to expect revenue growth above inflation.
* **Operating margin** \- I do think there’s room to improve the margins by reducing product development and general & administrative (as % of revenue). My assumption is that that it will increase to 14% over time.

Based on my input, the fair value of the company is **$3.2 billion ($29/share)**. This is significantly lower than the current market cap of **$5.7 billion ($51/share)**.

Anyone betting on Etsy is ultimately betting that:

1. The number of low-value products will decrease over time.
2. The number of buyers will start growing again
3. Etsy can continue increasing its take-rate, without losing sellers of high-value products.
4. The management will not engage in acquisition (as they are clearly bad at it).

"Gap shares surge as it raises guidance, touts ‘strong start’ to holiday","Hurricanes and unseasonably warm weather hit sales at Gap during its fiscal third quarter, but the apparel company still posted better-than-expected results, leading it to raise its annual guidance for a third time this year. 

Gap, which runs Old Navy, Banana Republic, Athleta and its namesake banner, is now expecting fiscal 2024 sales to be up between 1.5% and 2%, compared with previous guidance of “up slightly.” That’s ahead of the 0.4% growth that LSEG analysts had expected, and bodes well for the all-important holiday shopping season, which is now underway. 

The company is also anticipating gross margins and operating income will grow more than it previously expected.

Shares surged about 13% in extended trading.

Here’s how the nation’s largest specialty apparel retailer performed compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected
* **Revenue:** $3.83 billion vs. $3.81 billion expected

Gap’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $274 million, or 72 cents per share, compared with $218 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. 

Sales rose to $3.83 billion, up about 2% from $3.78 billion a year earlier.

Across Gap’s business, unseasonably warm weather affected sales by about 1 percentage point during the quarter, while storms and hurricanes led overall store sales to fall by 2%, CEO Richard Dickson told CNBC in an interview. 

“We had unusual circumstances, hurricanes, storms that led to almost 180 closures at the peak of the impact,” said Dickson, adding the storms affected Old Navy, Gap’s largest brand by revenue, the most. 

As soon as the weather turned around, sales “rebounded” and the holiday shopping season is off to a “strong start” so far, said Dickson. 

“We are energized about the holiday. Our teams are really focused on executing our plans. If we compare ourselves to where we were last year, our brands are in a much more pronounced place than they were last year,” he said. “We’ve got stronger brand identities and we’re more practiced in our playbook that we talk a lot about, driving better product, better pricing, more relevance, better consumer experience and excellence in execution.” 

Since Dickson took the helm of Gap a little over a year ago, he’s worked to turn around the business after years of declines. Under his direction, the company has leaned into nostalgic marketing and celebrity partnerships to reclaim cultural relevance. Sales have grown for the last four quarters in a row, but the company is still smaller than it once was, and critics say it needs to do more to fix its product assortment and drive full-price selling.

Here’s a closer look at each brand’s performance: 

**Old Navy:** Gap said sales at its largest brand grew 1% to $2.2 billion, while comparable sales were flat, shy of the 0.9% growth that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Old Navy’s kids category was particularly affected by the warmer weather, said Dickson. 

**Gap:** Gap’s eponymous banner grew 1% to $899 million during the quarter, while comparable sales were up 3% — better than the 2.3% growth Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount. The brand has seen four straight quarters of positive comparable sales and is benefiting from better marketing and product, the company said. 

**Banana Republic:** The trendy workwear line grew sales 2% to $469 million while comparable sales fell 1%, a bit worse than the 0.8% drop that StreetAccount had expected. The brand has worked to turn around its men’s business, which drove results during the quarter. Overall, it is still focused “on fixing the fundamentals,” the company said. 

**Athleta:** The athleisure arm of Gap’s empire grew sales by 4% to $290 million while comparable sales were up 5%. The results weren’t comparable to estimates. In the year-ago period, comparable sales were down 19% at Athleta. Under its new CEO, former Alo Yoga boss Chris Blakeslee, the brand has managed to turn things around.

Manchester United stock (NYSE: MANU) – potential to grow,"According to Forbes magazine Manchester United is the second most valuable club in football, only behind Real Madrid. Only Real Madrid and Barcelona have more fans in the world. This is despite the fact that last major trophy they won is Premier League in 2013.  This was the last season with Sir Alex Ferguson at the helm – he is the best manager in history of this club. He retired and since then they are struggling a lot and underperforming. Last season they finished 8^(th) in the Premier League, this season they are 13^(th). Disappointment. They play in Europa League, second tier competition in Europe. The real money is in Champions League.

They have a tremendous potential. Big history, a lot of fans, a lot of money. They should compete for the most important throphies every year. But they didn’t in previous years and fans are angry about that.

Things are subject to change though. At the end of 2023 Sir James Ratcliffe bought 25% of club’s shares. He is the fan of the club and he has a lot to say about how the club is run. He is committed to rebuilding club and bring back glory the club aspire to. On January 2024 Omar Berrada was appointed as new CEO of the club, chief executive officer. He joined United after 13 years spent in Manchester City that was the most successful club in England during this period. On July 2024 Dan Ashworth started to work as sporting director. He worked for Newcastle and Brighton previously. He did a really god job there. In Brighton under his watch they transferred in Caicedo, Mac Allister, Cucurella, Mitoma and Trossard, they sold them later for more money. In Newcastle he was in charged when they bought Isak, Gordon, Barnes, Tonali and Botman. Great business. Recently they hired Ruben Amorim, who was successful in Sporting Lisboa. In the summer he was considered as new Liverpool FC manager, eventually they decided to go with Arne Slot who is excellent in his new role.

The future for Manchester United is bright. They have a competent people running the club. Ruben Amorim is one of the best of young managers in the world and seems to be a really good pick who is able to transform the whole club like Jurgen Klopp did it at Liverpool in the last decade. He needs time but he seems to be capable of making Manchester United great again. They were underperforming in the last 10 years but finally they addressed the issues and should be performing better. They need a time, of course, to build strong team. The thing is – if they perform on the pitch, they earn more money. I believe it is the matter of time before they are on the top. And when they reach this level, when they compete amongst really the best, their stock price should be much higher than it is now.

I think they will be a strong again very soon, they will compete and good performance on the pitch will result with big amount of cash going to the club. The next 10 years should be much better than the last 10 years. Currently their stock price is 17,47 USD. They certainly has potential for more. One more reason is – there are more and more money in football every year so this is another factor in favor of this stock.

I think that this club will compete for Premier League and Champions League in 2-4 years and it should have a huge impact on their finances. My opinion is this stock has potential to grow. Am I wrong? What do you think? I am new in the stock market so maybe I am missing something.",0,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gxinau/manchester_united_stock_nyse_manu_potential_to/

*For the quarter ended October 31, Palo Alto Networks reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.56 versus the consensus estimate of $1.47. Revenue totaled $2.14B versus the estimate of $2.12B.*

*For the quarter in progress, Palo Alto Networks expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $1.54 to $1.56, with a mid-point that matches the estimate. Its revenue projection for the second quarter ranges from $2.22B to $2.25B, which represents 13% growth year over year. The mid-point of $2.235B comes in just above the estimate of $2.23B.*   

*Second quarter Next-Generation Security ARR is expected to range from $4.7B to $4.75B, which would represent a year-over-year increase of 20%.*

*Total revenue for fiscal year 2025, which runs from August 2024 through July 2025, is expected to range from $9.12B to $9.17B. This would represent 14% growth year over year.* 

*""Our platformization progress continued in Q1, driving strong financial results,"" said Dipak Golechha, chief financial officer of Palo Alto Networks. ""As a result, we are raising our NGS ARR, revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year.""*

*The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split, which will increase the number of authorized common shares from 1B to 2B. Trading on a split-adjusted basis is expected to begin on Dec. 16, 2024.*

I've been a big fan of PANW for the last 2 years. While the billings decline isn't great, it's been expected as the company pushes for platformization. I anticipate this to be great in the long term outlook, but short term, may seem like growth is slowing. Platformization will make their services sticky and harder for companies to leave because they'll be integrated across the business across multiple levels.

Although I'm a big fan of the stock, I will admit it's an expensive one. A lot hinges on future growth of the whole industry and if there are any signs of slowed growth, I think this one will hurt for investors buying at these levels. I'm not in cybersecurity so I'm not sure the likelihood of that, but I'd keep an eye on it. I've made several posts about PANW over the last year and my consensus is I will continue to buy monthly and if there's a large pull back down to <350 I'll look to make a large purchase with cash reserves.",58,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgtsd/palo_alto_networks_beats_q1_estimates_shares_fall/
Adani Group shares nosedive after chairman Gautam Adani charged with fraud in New York,"India’s Adani Group saw shares of its companies plunge Thursday after its billionaire chairman Gautam Adani was indicted in a New York federal court over his alleged involvement in an extensive bribery and fraud operation.

The 62-year-old billionaire and the seven other defendants have been accused of paying over $250 million in bribes to Indian government officials to secure solar energy contracts that could generate more than $2 billion in profits.

The Indian group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises fell 10%, while the company in the eye of the storm Adani Green Energy tanked 17.28%. Adani Energy fell 20%. 

Adani Power lost 13.81%, Adani Port’s share price dropped 10%, while the group’s retail arm Adani Wilmar shed 7.87%.

The benchmark NSE Nifty 50 Index slid 0.63% in its first hour of trade.

Adani, along with two executives from Adani Green Energy Limited — his nephew Sagar Adani and Vneet Jaain — have been charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about the company’s adherence to antibribery and anticorruption standards while raising over $3 billion to finance energy projects.

The five-count indictment in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn also accused Ranjit Gupta and Rupesh Agarwal, former executives of the renewable energy firm Azure Power Global, along with three former employees of the Canadian institutional investor Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec — Saurabh Agarwal, Cyril Cabanes, and Deepak Malhotra.

CDPQ said it is aware of the charges filed. “Those employees were all terminated in 2023 and CDPQ is cooperating with U.S. authorities,” the investor said in an email.

This comes after the conglomerate spent the bulk of last year attempting to move beyond the allegations of accounting fraud and “brazen stock manipulation” made by shortseller firm Hindenburg Research. 

“Since releasing our January 2023 report identifying Adani as the largest corporate con in history, we have never wavered in our view, nor has Adani ever refuted our findings,” Hindenburg said in a statement to CNBC on Thursday.

The conglomerate had rebutted the claims, adding that it has “always been in compliance with all laws.”

These charges do not change the “strong underlying fundamentals” of India’s market or the country’s growth trajectory, said Raymond James’ head of advisory solutions and market strategy, Matt Orton. 

“Once the dust settles, there will be even better opportunities for long-term investors in India,” he said.

"After being wrong about MBLY, BOFA doubles down: ""BofA Securities Trims Mobileye Global Price Target to $12 From $13""","Max pain for options on MBLY is misleading when we have over 20% of the float shorted and underwater, the smart ones closed when it was sold off, and then some trading professionals such as BOFA securities/their-friends/people-who listen-to-them, likely opened new shorts at the bottom and tried convincing others to follow their lead.

Then as we would usually see analysts revise their predictions after the market moves (especially if they called it wrong), to make it seem they are smart or something, BOFA securities revised their predictions, to be even more wrong, showing that they are doubling down on their/people-who-listen-to-theirtrading-advice shorts and are willing to be in denial on a stock even if the market decides they are wrong.

Its not the end of the world to have entrenched shorts, since at the end of the day their losses are unlimited, and when they do close its more capital injected, the longer they waited.

Any investors here looking at European markets ?,"Let me preface this by saying I live in Europe and after dabbling initially in companies closer to home switched to US markets due to higher historical returns.

This in hindsight was an excellent decision as almost all my investments in the S&P/Nasdaq have outperformed the ones listed in Europe. So do any American guys look at European markets and see any opportunity to create alpha or are bullish on the EU markets. 

There’s an argument to be made that potentially investing into EU serves as a way to diversify and lower exposure to US markets. But I find it very hard to find good European companies with solid fundamentals that have good stock performance. Could be a myriad of reasons including liquidity, slower growth, more regulation and government oversight. 

Personally the three companies I still have in my portfolio in the EU markets is RR, NVO and LVMH. LVMH is slowing down but most likely due to luxury market turmoil and exposure to China. Additionally NVO is listed on NYSE and had uptil recently performed rather well.

So finally my question being are any guys actively eschewing the American markets for European ones or actively increasing their allocation, if so would love to know the rationale. And more importantly any particular industries or geographies that you’re targeting? ",41,148,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gwgyqv/any_investors_here_looking_at_european_markets/
Thoughts on building a 10Y high risk portfolio,"Over the past few years I’ve built a portfolio consisting of S&P, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, JPM and BRK. It has done rather well, consistently giving returns of 25%+ annually (except 2022). 

However in recent times my conviction on adding more capital to this portfolio has waned. I just feel the best days in terms of returns for some of the big tech groups may not be what they were for the past decade.

I could 100% be wrong and there is no doubt there is certain bias seeing the return of my smaller positions this year dwarfing the ones of the traditional blue chip guys if you will.

So saying all this I’m considering: 

50% S&P

10% Hood

10% Rddt

10% Rolls Royce

10% Cava

5% Lunr

5% ASTS

Quick rationale for each:

Hood: Expanding to Europe and offering very exciting new products like Hood Gold 

Rddt: Fastest growing social media, ARPU and monetisation only getting better and seeing many more people using

Rolls Royce: Slight European exposure, building low cost Nuclear plants and capturing the wide body aircraft market

Cava: Fantastic management, strong customer retention and expected to double stores in next 5 years

Lunr & ASTS: Moonshot (literally), this is just in case space works out and much more speculative 



So having said all that, what is everyone’s thoughts on this proposed portfolio allocation. Is this too risky, not enough diversification into the different sectors? Any thoughts and opinions on this would be great!",0,46,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1gx83cf/thoughts_on_building_a_10y_high_risk_portfolio/
